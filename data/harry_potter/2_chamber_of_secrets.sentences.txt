THE WORST BIRTHDAY
Not for the first time, an argument had broken out over breakfast at number four, Privet Drive. 
Mr. Vernon Dursley had been woken in the early hours of the morning by a loud, hooting noise from his nephew ###CHAR68###'s room. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Third time this week!'' 
he roared across the table. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``If you can't control that owl, it'll have to go!'' 
###CHAR68### tried, yet again, to explain. 
###DIALOGUE###``She's bored,'' ###CHAR68### said. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``She's used to flying around outside. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###If I could just let her out at night -'' ``Do I look stupid?'' 
snarled Uncle ###CHAR35###, a bit of fried egg dangling from ###CHAR35###'s bushy mustache. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I know what'll happen if that owl's let out.'' 
###CHAR35### exchanged dark looks with ###CHAR35###'s wife, ###CHAR78###. 
###CHAR68### tried to argue back but ###CHAR68###'s words were drowned by a long, loud belch from the ###CHAR88###' son, ###CHAR1###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I want more bacon.'' 
###DIALOGUE###``There's more in the frying pan, sweetums,'' said ###CHAR78### , turning misty eyes on ###CHAR78###'s massive son. 
###DIALOGUE###``We must build you up while we've got the chance ... I don't like the sound of that school food ...'' ``Nonsense, Petunia, I never went hungry when I was at Smeltings,'' said Uncle ###CHAR35### heartily. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR1### gets enough, don't you, son?'' 
###CHAR1###, who was so large ###CHAR35###'s bottom drooped over either side of the kitchen chair, grinned and turned to ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Pass the frying pan.'' 
###DIALOGUE###``You've forgotten the magic word,'' said ###CHAR68### irritably. 
The effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was incredible: ###CHAR1### gasped and fell off ###CHAR1###'s chair with a crash that shook the whole kitchen; Mrs. Dursley gave a small scream and clapped ###CHAR78###'s hands to ###CHAR78###'s mouth; Mr. Dursley jumped to his feet, veins throbbing in his temples. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I meant `please'!'' 
said ###CHAR68### quickly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I didn't mean -'' ``WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU,'' thundered ###CHAR68###'s uncle, spraying spit over the table, ``ABOUT SAYING THE `M' WORD IN OUR HOUSE?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But I -'' ``HOW DARE YOU THREATEN DUDLEY!'' 
roared ###CHAR35### , pounding the table with ###CHAR35###'s fist. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I just -'' ``I WARNED YOU! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I WILL NOT TOLERATE MENTION OF YOUR ABNORMALITY UNDER THIS ROOF!'' 
###CHAR68### stared from ###CHAR68###'s purple-faced uncle to ###CHAR68###'s pale aunt, who was trying to heave ###CHAR1### to ###CHAR1###'s feet. 
###DIALOGUE###``All right,'' said ###CHAR68###, ``all right... '' Uncle ###CHAR35### sat back down, breathing like a winded rhinoceros and watching ###CHAR68### closely out of the corners of ###CHAR68###'s small, sharp eyes. 
Ever since ###CHAR68### had come home for the summer holidays, Uncle ###CHAR35### had been treating ###CHAR35### like a bomb that might go off at any moment, because ###CHAR54### wasn't a normal boy. 
As a matter of fact, ###CHAR54### was as not normal as it is possible to be. 
###CHAR54### was a wizard - a wizard fresh from ###CHAR54###'s first year at ###CHAR26### and Wizardry. 
And if the ###CHAR88### were unhappy to have ###CHAR54### back for the holidays, it was nothing to how ###CHAR68### felt. 
###CHAR68### missed ###CHAR26### so much it was like having a constant stomachache. 
###CHAR68### missed the castle, with its secret passageways and ghosts, ###CHAR68###'s classes -LRB-though perhaps not ###CHAR63###, the Potions master-RRB-, the mail arriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall, sleeping in his four-poster bed in the tower dormitory, visiting the gamekeeper, ###CHAR22###, in his cabin next to the Forbidden Forest in the grounds, and, especially, Quidditch, the most popular sport in the wizarding world -LRB-six tall goal posts, four flying balls, and fourteen players on broomsticks-RRB-. 
All ###CHAR68###'s spellbooks, ###CHAR68###'s wand, robes, cauldron, and top-of-the-line Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard under the stairs by Uncle Vernon the instant ###CHAR68### had come home. 
What did the ###CHAR88### care if ###CHAR68### lost ###CHAR68###'s place on the ###CHAR42### Quidditch team because ###CHAR68### hadn't practiced all summer? 
What was it to the Dursleys if ###CHAR68### went back to school without any of ###CHAR68###'s homework done? 
The Dursleys were what wizards called Muggles -LRB-not a drop of magical blood in their veins-RRB-, and as far as they were concerned, having a wizard in the family was a matter of deepest shame. 
Uncle ###CHAR35### had even padlocked ###CHAR68###'s owl, Hedwig, inside her cage, to stop her from carrying messages to anyone in the wizarding world. 
###CHAR68### looked nothing like the rest of the family. 
Uncle ###CHAR35### was large and neckless, with an enormous black mustache; Aunt ###CHAR78### was horse-faced and bony; ###CHAR1### was blond, pink, and porky. 
###CHAR68###, on the other hand, was small and skinny, with brilliant green eyes and jet-black hair that was always untidy. 
###CHAR68### wore round glasses, and on ###CHAR68###'s forehead was a thin, lightning-shaped scar. 
It was this scar that made ###CHAR68### so particularly unusual, even for a wizard. 
This scar was the only hint of ###CHAR68###'s very mysterious past, of the reason ###CHAR68### had been left on the ###CHAR88###' doorstep eleven years before. 
At the age of one year old, ###CHAR68### had somehow survived a curse from the greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, ###CHAR21### , whose name most witches and wizards still feared to speak. 
###CHAR68###'s parents had died in ###CHAR21###'s attack, but ###CHAR68### had escaped with ###CHAR68###'s lightning scar, and somehow - nobody understood why ###CHAR21###'s powers had been destroyed the instant ###CHAR68### had failed to kill ###CHAR68###. 
So ###CHAR68### had been brought up by ###CHAR68###'s dead mother's sister and her husband. 
###CHAR68### had spent ten years with the ###CHAR88###, never understanding why ###CHAR68### kept making odd things happen without meaning to, believing the ###CHAR88###' story that ###CHAR68### had got ###CHAR68###'s scar in the car crash that had killed ###CHAR68###'s parents. 
And then, exactly a year ago, ###CHAR26### had written to ###CHAR68###, and the whole story had come out. 
###CHAR68### had taken up ###CHAR68###'s place at wizard school, where ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68###'s scar were famous ... but now the school year was over, and ###CHAR68### was back with the ###CHAR88### for the summer, back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in something smelly. 
The ###CHAR88### hadn't even remembered that today happened to be ###CHAR68###'s twelfth birthday. 
###DIALOGUE###Of course, ###CHAR68###'s hopes hadn't been high; they'd never given ###CHAR68### a real present, let alone a cake - but to ignore it completely ... At that moment, Uncle ###CHAR35### cleared ###CHAR35###'s throat importantly and said, ``Now, as we all know, today is a very important day.'' 
###CHAR68### looked up, hardly daring to believe it. 
###DIALOGUE###``This could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career, '' said Uncle ###CHAR35###. 
###CHAR68### went back to ###CHAR68###'s toast. 
Of course, ###CHAR68### thought bitterly, Un cle ###CHAR35### was talking about the stupid dinner party. 
###CHAR35###'d been talk ing of nothing else for two weeks. 
Some rich builder and his wife were coming to dinner and Uncle ###CHAR35### was hoping to get a huge order from ###CHAR35### -LRB-Uncle ###CHAR35###'s company made drills-RRB-. 
###DIALOGUE###``I think we should run through the schedule one more time,'' said Uncle ###CHAR35###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We should all be in position at eight o'clock. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR78###, you will be -?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``In the lounge,'' said ###CHAR78### promptly, ``waiting to welcome them graciously to our home.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Good, good. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###And ###CHAR1###?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I'll be waiting to open the door.'' 
###CHAR1### put on a foul, simpering smile. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``May I take your coats, Mr. and ###CHAR79### ?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``They'll love ###CHAR1###!'' 
cried Aunt ###CHAR78### rapturously. 
###DIALOGUE###``Excellent, ###CHAR1###,'' said Uncle ###CHAR35###. 
Then ###CHAR35### rounded on ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``And you?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I'm not there,'' said ###CHAR68### tonelessly. 
###DIALOGUE###``Exactly,'' said Uncle ###CHAR35### nastily. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I will lead them into the lounge, introduce you, ###CHAR78###, and pour them -drinks. 
###DIALOGUE###At eightfifteen -'' ``I'll announce dinner,'' said ###CHAR78### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``And, ###CHAR1###, you'll say -'' ``May I take you through to the dining room, ###CHAR79### ?'' 
said ###CHAR1###, offering ###CHAR1###'s fat arm to an invisible woman. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``My perfect little gentleman!'' 
sniffed Aunt Petunia. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``And you?'' 
said Uncle ###CHAR35### viciously to ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``I'll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I'm not there,'' said ###CHAR68### dully. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Precisely. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Now, we should aim to get in a few good compliments at dinner. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR78###, any ideas?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Vernon tells me you're a wonderful golfer, ###CHAR32### ... Do tell me where you bought your dress, ###CHAR79### ...'' ``Perfect... ###CHAR1###?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``How about -`We had to write an essay about our hero at school, ###CHAR32### , and I wrote about you.''' 
This was too much for both Aunt Petunia and ###CHAR68###. 
Aunt ###CHAR78### burst into tears and hugged ###CHAR78###'s son, while ###CHAR68### ducked under the table so they wouldn't see ###CHAR68### laughing. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``And you, boy?'' 
###CHAR68### fought to keep ###CHAR68###'s face straight as ###CHAR68### emerged. 
###DIALOGUE###``I'll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I'm not there,'' ###CHAR68### said. 
###DIALOGUE###``Too right, you will,'' said Uncle Vernon forcefully. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``The Ma sons don't know anything about you and it's going to stay that way. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###When dinner's over, you take ###CHAR79### back to the lounge for coffee, Petunia, and I'll bring the subject around to drills. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###With any luck, I'll have the deal signed and sealed before the news at ten. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###be shopping for a vacation home in Majorca this time to morrow. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### couldn't feel too excited about this. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### didn't think the ###CHAR88### would like ###CHAR68### any better in Majorca than they did on Privet Drive. 
###DIALOGUE###``Right - I'm off into town to pick up the dinner jackets for ###CHAR1### and me. 
###DIALOGUE###And you,'' he snarled at ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You stay out of your aunt's way while she's cleaning.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### left through the back door. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It was a brilliant, sunny day. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR68### crossed the lawn, slumped down on the garden bench, and sang under ###CHAR68###'s breath: ``Happy birthday to me ... happy birthday to me... No cards, no presents, and ###CHAR1### would be spending the evening pretending not to exist. 
###CHAR1### gazed miserably into the hedge. 
###CHAR1### had never felt so lonely. 
More than anything else at ###CHAR26###, more even than playing Quidditch, ###CHAR68### missed ###CHAR68###'s best friends, ###CHAR46### and ###CHAR25### . 
They, however, didn't seem to be missing ###CHAR68### at all. 
Neither of them had written to ###CHAR68### all summer, even though ###CHAR68### had said ###CHAR68### was going to ask ###CHAR68### to come and stay. 
Countless times, ###CHAR68### had been on the point of unlocking Hedwig's cage by magic and sending her to ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### with a letter, but it wasn't worth the risk. 
Underage wizards weren't allowed to use magic outside of school. 
###CHAR68### hadn't told the ###CHAR88### this; ###CHAR68### knew it was only their terror that ###CHAR68### might turn them all into dung beetles that stopped them from locking ###CHAR68### in the cupboard under the stairs with ###CHAR68###'s wand and broomstick. 
For the first couple of weeks back, ###CHAR68### had enjoyed muttering nonsense words under ###CHAR68###'s breath and watching ###CHAR1### tearing out of the room as fast as ###CHAR68###'s fat legs would carry ###CHAR68###. 
But the long silence from ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### had made ###CHAR68### feel so cut off from the magical world that even taunting ###CHAR1### had lost its appeal - and now ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### had forgotten ###CHAR68###'s birthday. 
What wouldn't ###CHAR68### give now for a message from ###CHAR26###? 
From any witch or wizard? 
He'd almost be glad of a sight of his archenemy, ###CHAR0### , just to be sure it hadn't all been a dream ... Not that his whole year at ###CHAR26### had been fun. 
At the very end of last term, ###CHAR68### had come face-to-face with none other than ###CHAR21### himself. 
###CHAR21### might be a ruin of ###CHAR21###'s former self, but ###CHAR21### was still terrifying, still cunning, still determined to regain power. 
###CHAR68### had slipped through ###CHAR21###'s clutches for a second time, but it had been a narrow escape, and even now, weeks later, ###CHAR68### kept waking in the night, drenched in cold sweat, wondering where ###CHAR21### was now, remembering ###CHAR21###'s livid face, ###CHAR21###'s wide, mad eyes ###CHAR68### suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench. 
###CHAR68### had been staring absent-mindedly into the hedge - and the hedge was staring back. 
Two enormous green eyes had appeared among the leaves. 
###CHAR68### jumped to ###CHAR68###'s feet just as a jeering voice floated across the lawn. 
###DIALOGUE###``I know what day it is,'' sang ###CHAR1###, waddling toward ###CHAR1###. 
The huge eyes blinked and vanished. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What?'' 
said ###CHAR68###, not taking ###CHAR68###'s eyes off the spot where they had been. 
###DIALOGUE###``I know what day it is,'' ###CHAR1### repeated, coming right up to ###CHAR1###. 
###DIALOGUE###``Well done,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``So you've finally learned the days of the week.'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Today's your birthday,'' sneered ###CHAR1###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``How come you haven't got any cards? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Haven't you even got friends at that freak place?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Better not let your mum hear you talking about my school,'' said ###CHAR68### coolly. 
###CHAR1### hitched up ###CHAR68###'s trousers, which were slipping down ###CHAR68###'s fat bottom. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Why're you staring at the hedge?'' 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR68### said suspiciously. '' 
###DIALOGUE###I , m trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it on fire,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###CHAR1### stumbled backward at once, a look of panic on ###CHAR1###'s fat face. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You c-can't - ###CHAR53### told you you're not to do m-magic - ###CHAR53### said ###CHAR53###'ll chuck you out of the house - and you haven't got anywhere else to go - you haven't got any friends to take you -'' ``Jiggery pokery!'' 
said ###CHAR68### in a fierce voice. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Hocus pocus squiggly wiggly -'' ``MUUUUUUM!'' 
howled ###CHAR1###, tripping over ###CHAR68###'s feet as ###CHAR68### dashed back toward the house. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``MUUUUM! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR53###'s doing you know what!'' 
###CHAR68### paid dearly for ###CHAR68###'s moment of fun. 
As neither ###CHAR1### nor the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew ###CHAR1### hadn't really done magic, but ###CHAR1### still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at ###CHAR1###'s head with the soapy frying pan. 
Then she gave ###CHAR1### work to do, with the promise ###CHAR1### wouldn't eat again until ###CHAR1###'d finished. 
While ###CHAR1### lolled around watching and eating ice cream, ###CHAR68### cleaned the windows, washed the car, mowed the lawn, trimmed the flowerbeds, pruned and watered the roses, and repainted the garden bench. 
The sun blazed overhead, burning the back of ###CHAR68###'s neck. 
###CHAR68### knew ###CHAR68### shouldn't have risen to ###CHAR1###'s bait, but ###CHAR1### had said the very thing ###CHAR68### had been thinking himself... maybe ###CHAR68### didn't have any friends at Hogwarts ... Wish they could see famous ###CHAR54### now, ###CHAR54### thought savagely as ###CHAR54### spread manure on the flower beds, ###CHAR54###'s back aching, sweat running down ###CHAR54###'s face. 
It was half past seven ,in the evening when at last, exhausted, ###CHAR54### heard Aunt ###CHAR78### calling ###CHAR54###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Get in here! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###And walk on the newspaper!'' 
###CHAR68### moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen. 
On top of the fridge stood tonight's pudding: a huge mound of whipped cream and sugared violets. 
A loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Eat quickly! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The Masons will be here soon!'' 
snapped ###CHAR78### , pointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheese on the kitchen table. 
###CHAR78### was already wearing a salmon-pink cocktail dress. 
###CHAR68### washed ###CHAR68###'s hands and bolted down ###CHAR68###'s pitiful supper. 
The moment ###CHAR68### had finished, ###CHAR78### whisked away ###CHAR68###'s plate. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Upstairs! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Hurry!'' 
As ###CHAR68### passed the door to the living room, ###CHAR68### caught a glimpse of Uncle Vernon and ###CHAR1### in bow ties and dinner jack ets. 
###CHAR68### had only just reached the upstairs landing when the door bell rang and Uncle ###CHAR35###'s furious face appeared at the foot of the stairs. 
###DIALOGUE###``Remember, boy - one sound -'' ###CHAR68### crossed to ###CHAR68###'s bedroom on tiptoe slipped inside, closed the door, and turned to collapse on ###CHAR68###'s bed. 
The trouble was, there was already someone sitting on it.
###CHAR48###'S WARNING
###CHAR68### managed not to shout out, but it was a close thing. 
The little creature on the bed had large, bat-like ears and bulging green eyes the size of tennis balls. 
###CHAR68### knew instantly that this was what had been watching ###CHAR68### out of the garden hedge that morning. 
As they stared at each other, ###CHAR68### heard ###CHAR1###'s voice from the hall. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``May I take your coats, Mr. and ###CHAR79### ?'' 
The creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its long, thin nose touched the carpet. 
###CHAR68### noticed that it was wearing what looked like an old pillowcase, with rips for arm- and leg-holes. 
###DIALOGUE###``Er - hello,'' said ###CHAR68### nervously. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR54### !'' 
said the creature in a high-pitched voice ###CHAR68### was sure would carry down the stairs. 
###DIALOGUE###``So long has ###CHAR48### wanted to meet you, sir ... Such an honor it is ...'' ``Th-thank you,'' said ###CHAR68###, edging along the wall and sinking into ###CHAR68###'s desk chair, next to ###CHAR33###, who was asleep in ###CHAR33###'s large cage. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR68### wanted to ask, ``What are you?'' 
###DIALOGUE###but thought it would sound too rude, so instead ###CHAR68### said, ``Who are you?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Dobby, sir. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Just ###CHAR48###. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR48### the house-elf,'' said the creature. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Oh - really?'' 
said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Er - I don't want to be rude or anything, but - this isn't a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom.'' 
Aunt Petunias high, false laugh sounded from the living room. 
The elf hung ###CHAR68###'s head. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Not that I'm not pleased to meet you,'' said ###CHAR68### quickly, ``but, er, is there any particular reason you're here?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Oh, yes, sir,'' said ###CHAR48### earnestly. 
###DIALOGUE###``###CHAR48### has come to tell you, sir ... it is difficult, sir ... ###CHAR48### wonders where to begin ...'' ``Sit down,'' said ###CHAR68### politely, pointing at the bed. 
To ###CHAR68###'s horror, the elf burst into tears - very noisy tears. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``S-sit down!'' 
###CHAR68### wailed. 
###DIALOGUE###``Never ... never ever... '' ###CHAR68### thought ###CHAR68### heard the voices downstairs falter. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I'm sorry,'' ###CHAR68### whispered, ``I didn't mean to offend you or anything -'' ``Offend Dobby!'' 
choked the elf. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR48### has never been asked to sit down by a wizard - like an equal-'' ###CHAR68###, trying to say ``Shh!'' 
and look comforting at the same time, ushered ###CHAR48### back onto the bed where ###CHAR68### sat hiccoughing, looking like a large and very ugly doll. 
At last ###CHAR68### managed to control himself, and sat with ###CHAR68###'s great eyes fixed on ###CHAR68### in an expression of watery adoration. 
###DIALOGUE###``You can't have met many decent wizards,'' said ###CHAR68###, trying to cheer ###CHAR68### up. 
###CHAR48### shook ###CHAR68###'s head. 
###DIALOGUE###Then, without warning, ###CHAR68### leapt up and started banging ###CHAR68###'s head furiously on the window, shouting, ``Bad Dobby! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Bad Dobby!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Don't - what are you doing?'' 
###CHAR68### hissed, springing up and pulling ###CHAR48### back onto the bed - ###CHAR33### had woken up with a particularly loud screech and was beating ###CHAR33###'s wings wildly against the bars of ###CHAR33###'s cage. 
###DIALOGUE###``###CHAR48### had to punish himself, sir,'' said the elf, who had gone slightly cross-eyed. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir ...'' ``Your family?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``The wizard family ###CHAR48### serves, sir... ###CHAR48###'S is a houseelf - bound to serve one house and one family forever . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###... ``Do they know you're here?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###asked ###CHAR68### curiously. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR48### shuddered. 
###DIALOGUE###``Oh, no, sir, no ... ###CHAR48### will have to punish himself most grievously for coming to see you, sir. 
###CHAR48### will have to shut his ears in the oven door for this. 
###DIALOGUE###If they ever knew, sir _'' ``But won't they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Dobby doubts it, sir. 
###CHAR48### is always having to punish himself for something, sir. 
They lets ###CHAR48### get on with it, sir. 
Sometimes they reminds me to do extra punishments ...'' ``But why don't you leave? 
###DIALOGUE###Escape?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``A house-elf must be set free, sir. 
###DIALOGUE###And the family will never set ###CHAR48### free ... ###CHAR48### will serve the family until he dies, sir ...'' ###CHAR68### stared. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``And I thought I had it bad staying here for another four weeks,'' ###CHAR68### said. 
###DIALOGUE###``This makes the Dursleys sound almost human. 
Can't anyone help you? 
###DIALOGUE###Can't I?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Almost at once, ###CHAR68### wished ###CHAR68### hadn't spoken. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR48### dissolved again into wails of gratitude. 
###DIALOGUE###``Please,'' ###CHAR68### whispered frantically, ``please be quiet. 
If the ###CHAR88### hear anything, if they know you're here -'' ``###CHAR54### asks if ###CHAR54### can help ###CHAR48### ... ###CHAR48### has heard of your greatness, sir, but of your goodness, ###CHAR48### never knew . 
###DIALOGUE###... ###CHAR68###, who was feeling distinctly hot in the face, said, ``Whatever you've heard about my greatness is a load of rubbish. 
###DIALOGUE###I'm not even top of my year at ###CHAR26###; that's ###CHAR25###, ###CHAR25### -'' But ###CHAR68### stopped quickly, because thinking about ###CHAR25### was painful. 
###DIALOGUE###``I-Tarry ###CHAR54### is humble and modest,'' said ###CHAR48### reverently, ###CHAR68###'s orblike eyes aglow. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR54### speaks not of ###CHAR54###'s triumph over He-Who- Must-Not-Be-Named -'' ``###CHAR21###?'' 
said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR48### clapped ###CHAR68###'s hands over ###CHAR68###'s bat ears and moaned, ``Ah, speak not the name, sir! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Speak not the name!'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Sorry'' said ###CHAR68### quickly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I know lots of people don't like it. 
###DIALOGUE###My friend ###CHAR68### -'' ###CHAR68### stopped again. 
Thinking about ###CHAR68### was painful, too. 
###CHAR48### leaned toward ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR68###'s eyes wide as headlights. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###`###CHAR48### heard tell,'' ###CHAR68### said hoarsely, ``that ###CHAR54### met the Dark Lord for a second time just weeks ago ... that ###CHAR54### escaped Yet again. '' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### nodded and ###CHAR48###'s eyes suddenly shone with tears. 
###DIALOGUE###,Ah, sir,'' ###CHAR68### gasped, dabbing ###CHAR68###'s face with a corner of the grubby pillowcase ###CHAR68### was wearing. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR54### is valiant and bold! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR54### has braved so many dangers already! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###But ###CHAR48### has come to protect ###CHAR54### , to warn ###CHAR54###, even if ###CHAR54### does have to shut ###CHAR54###'s ears in the oven door later... ###CHAR54### must notgo back to ###CHAR26###.'' 
There was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forks from downstairs and the distant rumble of Uncle Vernon's voice. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``W-what?'' 
###CHAR68### stammered. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But I've got to go back - term starts on September first. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It's all that's keeping me going. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###You don't know what it's like here. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I don't belong here. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I belong in your world - at Hogwarts.'' 
###DIALOGUE###``No, no, no,'' squeaked ###CHAR48###, shaking ###CHAR68###'s head so hard ###CHAR68###'s ears flapped. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR54### must stay where ###CHAR54### is safe. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR54### is too great, too good, to lose. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###If ###CHAR54### goes back to ###CHAR26###, ###CHAR54### will be in mortal danger.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Why?'' 
said ###CHAR68### in surprise. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``There is a plot, ###CHAR54### . 
###DIALOGUE###A plot to make most terrible things happen at ###CHAR26### and Wizardry this year,'' whispered ###CHAR48###, suddenly trembling all over. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR48### has known it for months, sir. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR54### must not put himself in peril. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR54### is too important, sir!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What terrible things?'' 
said ###CHAR68### at once. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Who's plotting them?'' 
###CHAR48### made a funny choking noise and then banged ###CHAR68###'s head frantically against the wall. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``All right!'' 
cried ###CHAR68###, grabbing the elf's arm to stop ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You can't tell me. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I understand. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###But why are you warning me?'' 
A sudden, unpleasant thought struck ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Hang on - this hasn't got anything to do with Vol- - sorry - with You-Know-Who, has it? 
###DIALOGUE###You could just shake or nod,'' ###CHAR68### added hastily as ###CHAR48###'s head tilted worryingly close to the wall again. 
Slowly, ###CHAR48### shook ###CHAR68###'s head. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Not -not ###CHAR54###- Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, sir =' But ###CHAR48###'s eyes were wide and ###CHAR54### seemed to be trying to give ###CHAR68### a hint. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###, however, was completely lost. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR68### hasn't got a brother, has ###CHAR68###?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR48### shook ###CHAR68###'s head, ###CHAR68###'s eyes wider than ever. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Well then, I can't think who else would have a chance of making horrible things happen at ###CHAR26###,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I mean, there's ###CHAR94###, for one thing - you know who ###CHAR94### is, don't you?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR48### bowed ###CHAR68###'s head. 
###DIALOGUE###``###CHAR94### is the greatest headmaster ###CHAR26### has ever had. 
###CHAR48### knows it, sir. 
###CHAR48### has heard ###CHAR94###'s powers rival those of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named at the height of ###CHAR94###'s strength. 
###DIALOGUE###But, sir'' - ###CHAR48###'s voice dropped to an urgent whisper - ``there are powers ###CHAR94### doesn't ... powers no decent wizard...'' And before ###CHAR68### could stop ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR48### bounded off the bed, seized ###CHAR68###'s desk lamp, and started beating himself around the head with earsplitting yelps. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###A sudden silence fell downstairs. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Two seconds later ###CHAR68###, heart thudding madly, heard Uncle Vernon coming into the hall, calling, ``###CHAR1### must have left ###CHAR1###'s television on again, the little tyke!'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Quick! 
###DIALOGUE###In the closet!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###hissed ###CHAR68###, stuffing ###CHAR48### in, shutting the door, and flinging himself onto the bed just as the door handle turned. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What - the - devil - are - you - doing?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said Uncle ###CHAR35### through gritted teeth, ###CHAR35###'s face horribly close to ###CHAR68###'s. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You've just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke ... One more sound and you'll wish you'd never been born, boy!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### stomped flat-footed from the room. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Shaking, Harry let Dobby out of the closet. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``See what it's like here?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###he said. 
###DIALOGUE###``See why I've got to go back to Hogwarts? 
###DIALOGUE###It's the only place I've got -well, I think I've got friends. '' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Friends who don't even write to ###CHAR54### ?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR48### slyly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I expect they've just been - wait a minute,'' said ###CHAR68###, frowning. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``How do you know my friends haven't been writing to me?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR48### shuffled ###CHAR68###'s feet. 
###DIALOGUE###``###CHAR54### mustn't be angry with ###CHAR48###. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR48### did it for the best - '' ``Have you been stopping my letters?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR48### has them here, sir,'' said the elf. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Stepping nimbly out of ###CHAR68###'s reach, ###CHAR68### pulled a thick wad of envelopes from the inside of the pillowcase ###CHAR68### was wearing. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### could make out ###CHAR25###'s neat writing, ###CHAR68###'s untidy scrawl, and even a scribble that looked as though it was from the ###CHAR26### gamekeeper, ###CHAR22###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR48### blinked anxiously up at ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``###CHAR54### mustn't be angry... ###CHAR48### hoped ... if ###CHAR54### thought ###CHAR54###'s friends had forgotten ###CHAR54### ... ###CHAR54### might not want to go back to school, sir . 
... ###CHAR68### wasn't listening. 
###CHAR68### made a grab for the letters, but ###CHAR48### jumped out of reach. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR54### will have them, sir, if ###CHAR54### gives ###CHAR48### ###CHAR54###'s word that ###CHAR54### will not return to Hogwarts. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Ah, sir, this is a danger you must not face! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Say you won't go back, sir!'' 
###DIALOGUE###``No,'' said ###CHAR68### angrily. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Give me my friends' letters!'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Then ###CHAR54### leaves ###CHAR48### no choice,'' said the elf sadly. 
Before ###CHAR68### could move, ###CHAR48### had darted to the bedroom door, pulled it open, and sprinted down the stairs. 
Mouth dry, stomach lurching, ###CHAR68### sprang after ###CHAR68###, trying not to make a sound. 
###CHAR68### jumped the last six steps, landing catlike on the hall carpet, looking around for ###CHAR48###. 
###DIALOGUE###From the dining room ###CHAR68### heard Uncle ###CHAR35### saying, ''... tell ###CHAR78### that very funny story about those American plumbers, ###CHAR32### . 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR78###'s been dying to hear... '' ###CHAR68### ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt ###CHAR68###'s stomach disappear. 
Aunt ###CHAR78###'s masterpiece of a pudding, the mountain of cream and sugared violets, was floating up near the ceiling. 
On top of a cupboard in the corner crouched ###CHAR48###. 
###DIALOGUE###``No,'' croaked ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Please ... they'll kill me ...'' ``###CHAR54### must say ###CHAR54###'s not going back to school -'' ``Dobby ... please ... ``Say it, sir -'' ``I can't -'' ###CHAR48### gave ###CHAR68### a tragic look. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Then ###CHAR48### must do it, sir, for ###CHAR54### 's own good.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The pudding fell to the floor with a heart-stopping crash. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Cream splattered the windows and walls as the dish shattered. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###With a crack like a whip, ###CHAR48### vanished. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There were screams from the dining room and Uncle Vernon burst into the kitchen to find ###CHAR68###, rigid with shock, covered from head to foot in Aunt Petunias pudding. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###At first, it looked as though Uncle ###CHAR35### would manage to gloss the whole thing over. 
###DIALOGUE###-LRB-``Just our nephew - very disturbed meeting strangers upsets ###CHAR54###, so we kept ###CHAR54### upstairs-RRB- ###CHAR54### shooed the shocked Masons back into the dining room, promised ###CHAR68### would flay ###CHAR68### to within an inch of ###CHAR68###'s life when the Masons had left, and handed ###CHAR68### a mop. 
Aunt ###CHAR78### dug some ice cream out of the freezer and ###CHAR68###, still shaking, started scrubbing the kitchen clean. 
Uncle Vernon might still have been able to make his deal - if it hadn't been for the owl. 
Aunt ###CHAR78### was just passing around a box of after-dinner mints when a huge barn owl swooped through the dining room window, dropped a letter on ###CHAR79### 's head, and swooped out again. 
###CHAR79### screamed like a banshee and ran from the house shouting about lunatics. 
###CHAR32### stayed just long enough to tell the ###CHAR88### that ###CHAR32###'s wife was mortally afraid of birds of all shapes and sizes, and to ask whether this was their idea of a joke. 
###CHAR68### stood in the kitchen, clutching the mop for support, as Uncle Vernon advanced on him, a demonic glint in his tiny eyes. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Read it!'' 
###CHAR35### hissed evilly, brandishing the letter the owl had delivered. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Go on - read it!'' 
###CHAR68### took it. 
It did not contain birthday greetings.
Dear ###CHAR95### ,
We have received intelligence that a Hover Charm was used at your place of residence this evening at twelve minutes past nine. 
As you know, underage wizards are not permitted to perform spells outside school, and further spellwork on your part may lead to expulsion from said school -LRB-Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery, 1875, Paragraph C-RRB-. 
We would also ask you to remember that any magical activity that risks notice by members of the non-magical community -LRB-Muggles-RRB- is a serious offense under section 13 of the International Confederation of Warlocks' Statute of Secrecy.
Enjoy your holidays! 
Yours sincerely, Mafalda Hopkirk
IMPROPER USE OF MAGIC OFFICE Ministry of Magic
Harry looked up from the letter and gulped. 
###DIALOGUE###``You didn't tell us you weren't allowed to use magic outside school,'' said ###CHAR35### , a mad gleam dancing in ###CHAR35###'s eyes. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``For got to mention it ... Slipped your mind, I daresay ... He was bearing down on Harry like a great bulldog, all his teeth bared. 
###DIALOGUE###``Well, I've got news for you, boy . 
###DIALOGUE###... I'm locking you up ... You're never going back to that school ... never ... and if you try and magic yourself out - they'll expel you!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###And laughing like a maniac, ###CHAR35### dragged ###CHAR68### back upstairs. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Uncle ###CHAR35### was as bad as ###CHAR35###'s word. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The following morning, ###CHAR35### paid a man to fit bars on ###CHAR68###'s window. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### himself fitted a catflap in the bedroom door, so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They let ###CHAR68### out to use the bathroom morning and evening. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Otherwise, ###CHAR68### was locked in ###CHAR68###'s room around the clock. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Three days later, the ###CHAR88### were showing no sign of relenting, and ###CHAR68### couldn't see any way out of ###CHAR68###'s situation. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### lay on ###CHAR68###'s bed watching the sun sinking behind the bars on the window and wondered miserably what was going to happen to ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###What was the good of magicking himself out of ###CHAR68###'s room if ###CHAR26### would expel ###CHAR26### for doing it? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Yet life at Privet Drive had reached an all-time low. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Now that the ###CHAR88### knew they weren't going to wake up as fruit bats, ###CHAR26### had lost ###CHAR26###'s only weapon. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR48### might have saved ###CHAR68### from horrible happenings at Hogwarts, but the way things were going, ###CHAR68###'d probably starve to death anyway. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The cat-flap rattled and Aunt Petunias hand appeared, pushing a bowl of canned soup into the room. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###, whose insides were aching with hunger, jumped off ###CHAR68###'s bed and seized it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The soup was stone-cold, but ###CHAR68### drank half of it in one gulp. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Then ###CHAR68### crossed the room to ###CHAR33###'s cage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into ###CHAR33###'s empty food tray. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR33### ruffled ###CHAR33###'s feathers and gave ###CHAR68### a look of deep disgust. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It's no good turning your beak up at it - that's all we've got,'' said ###CHAR68### grimly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the cat-flap and lay back down on the bed, somehow even hungrier than ###CHAR68### had been before the soup. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Supposing ###CHAR68### was still alive in another four weeks, what would happen if ###CHAR68### didn't turn up at Hogwarts? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Would someone be sent to see why ###CHAR68### hadn't come back? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Would they be able to make the ###CHAR88### let ###CHAR68### go? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The room was growing dark. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Exhausted, stomach rumbling, mind spinning over the same unanswerable questions, ###CHAR68### fell into an uneasy sleep. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### dreamed that ###CHAR68### was on show in a zoo, with a card reading UNDERAGE WIZARD attached to ###CHAR68###'s cage. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###People goggled through the bars at ###CHAR68### as ###CHAR68### lay, starving and weak, on a bed of straw. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### saw ###CHAR48###'s face in the crowd and shouted out, asking for help, but ###CHAR48### called, ``###CHAR54### is safe there, sir!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###and vanished. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Then the ###CHAR88### appeared and ###CHAR1### rattled the bars of the cage, laughing at ###CHAR1###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Stop it,'' ###CHAR68### muttered as the rattling pounded in ###CHAR68###'s sore head. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Leave me alone ... cut it out ... I'm trying to sleep ...'' ###CHAR68### opened ###CHAR68###'s eyes. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Moonlight was shining through the bars on the window. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###And someone was goggling through the bars at ###CHAR68###: a frecklefaced, red-haired, long-nosed someone. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR46### was outside ###CHAR68###'s window.
THE BURROW
###DIALOGUE###``###CHAR68###,'' breathed ###CHAR68###, creeping to the window and pushing it up so they could talk through the bars. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR68###, how did you - What the -?'' 
###CHAR68###'s mouth fell open as the full impact of what ###CHAR68### was seeing hit ###CHAR68###. 
###CHAR68### was leaning out of the back window of an old turquoise car, which was parked in midair Grinning at Harry from the front seats were ###CHAR55### and ###CHAR19###, ###CHAR68###'s elder twin brothers. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``All right, ###CHAR68###?'' 
asked ###CHAR19###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What's been going on?'' 
said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Why haven't you been answering my letters? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I've asked you to stay about twelve times, and then Dad came home and said you'd got an official warning for using magic in front of Muggles -'' ``It wasn't me - and how did he know?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``He works for the Ministry,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``You know we're not supposed to do spells outside school -'' ``You should talk,'' said ###CHAR68###, staring at the floating car. 
###DIALOGUE###``Oh, this doesn't count,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We're only borrowing this. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It's Dad's, we didn't enchant it. 
###DIALOGUE###But doing magic in front of those Muggles you live with -'' ``I told you, I didn't - but it'll take too long to explain now look, can you tell them at Hogwarts that the ###CHAR88### have locked me up and won't let me come back, and obviously I can't magic myself out, because the Ministry'Il think that's the second spell I've done in three days, so -'' ``Stop gibbering,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We've come to take you home with us.'' 
###DIALOGUE###``But you can't magic me out either -'' ``We don't need to,'' said ###CHAR68###, jerking ###CHAR68###'s head toward the front seat and grinning. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You forget who I've got with me.'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Tie that around the bars,'' said ###CHAR55###, throwing the end of a rope to ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``If the ###CHAR88### wake up, I'm dead,'' said ###CHAR68### as ###CHAR68### tied the rope tightly around a bar and ###CHAR55### revved up the car. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Don't worry,'' said ###CHAR55###, ``and stand back.'' 
###CHAR68### moved back into the shadows next to ###CHAR33###, who seemed to have realized how important this was and kept still and silent. 
The car revved louder and louder and suddenly, with a crunching noise, the bars were pulled clean out of the window as ###CHAR55### drove straight up in the air. 
###CHAR68### ran back to the window to see the bars dangling a few feet above the ground. 
Panting, ###CHAR68### hoisted them up into the car. 
###CHAR68### listened anxiously, but there was no sound from the ###CHAR88###' bedroom. 
When the bars were safely in the back seat with ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR55### reversed as close as possible to ###CHAR68###'s window. 
###DIALOGUE###``Get in,'' ###CHAR68### said. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But all my Hogwarts stuff - my wand - my broomstick -'' ``Where is it?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Locked in the cupboard under the stairs, and I can't get out of this room -'' ``No problem,'' said ###CHAR19### from the front passenger seat. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Out of the way, ###CHAR68###.'' 
###CHAR55### and ###CHAR19### climbed catlike through the window into ###CHAR68###'s room. 
You had to hand it to them, thought ###CHAR68###, as ###CHAR19### took an ordinary hairpin from ###CHAR19###'s pocket and started to pick the lock. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``A lot of wizards think it's a waste of time, knowing this sort of Muggle trick,'' said ###CHAR55###, ``but we feel they're skills worth learning, even if they are a bit slow.'' 
There was a small click and the door swung open. 
###DIALOGUE###``So - we'll get your trunk - you grab anything you need from your room and hand it out to ###CHAR68###,'' whispered ###CHAR19###. 
###DIALOGUE###``Watch out for the bottom stair - it creaks,'' ###CHAR68### whispered back as the twins disappeared onto the dark landing. 
###CHAR68### dashed around ###CHAR68###'s room, collecting ###CHAR68###'s things and passing them out of the window to ###CHAR68###. 
Then ###CHAR68### went to help ###CHAR55### and ###CHAR19### heave ###CHAR55###'s trunk up the stairs. 
###CHAR68### heard Uncle Vernon cough. 
At last, panting, they reached the landing, then carried the trunk through ###CHAR68###'s room to the open window. 
###CHAR55### climbed back into the car to pull with ###CHAR68###, and ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR19### pushed from the bedroom side. 
Inch by inch, the trunk slid through the window. 
Uncle ###CHAR35### coughed again. 
###DIALOGUE###``A bit more,'' panted ###CHAR55###, who was pulling from inside the car. 
###DIALOGUE###``One good push -'' ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR19### threw their shoulders against the trunk and it slid out of the window into the back seat of the car. 
###DIALOGUE###``Okay, let's go,'' ###CHAR19### whispered. 
But as ###CHAR68### climbed onto the windowsill there came a sudden loud screech from behind ###CHAR68###, followed immediately by the thunder of Uncle ###CHAR35###'s voice. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``THAT RUDDY OWL!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I've forgotten Hedwig!'' 
###CHAR68### tore back across the room as the landing light clicked on - ###CHAR68### snatched up ###CHAR33###'s cage, dashed to the window, and passed it out to ###CHAR68###. 
###CHAR68### was scrambling back onto the chest of drawers when Uncle ###CHAR35### hammered on the unlocked door and it crashed open. 
For a split second, Uncle ###CHAR35### stood framed in the doorway; then ###CHAR35### let out a bellow like an angry bull and dived at ###CHAR68###, grabbing ###CHAR68### by the ankle. 
###CHAR68###, ###CHAR55###, and ###CHAR19### seized ###CHAR68###'s arms and pulled as hard as they could. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Petunia!'' 
roared Uncle ###CHAR35###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR68###'s getting away! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###'S GETTING AWAY!'' 
###DIALOGUE###But the Weasleys gave a gigantic tug and ###CHAR68###'s leg slid out of Uncle ###CHAR35###'s grasp - ###CHAR68### was in the car - ###CHAR68###'d slammed the door shut ``Put your foot down, ###CHAR55###!'' 
yelled ###CHAR68###, and the car shot suddenly toward the moon. 
###CHAR68### couldn't believe it - ###CHAR68### was free. 
###CHAR68### rolled down the window, the night air whipping ###CHAR68###'s hair, and looked back at the shrinking rooftops of Privet Drive. 
Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and ###CHAR1### were all hanging, dumbstruck, out of ###CHAR68###'s window. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``See you next summer!'' 
###CHAR68### yelled. 
The Weasleys roared with laughter and ###CHAR68### settled back in ###CHAR68###'s seat, grinning from ear to ear. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Let Hedwig out,'' ###CHAR68### told ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``She can fly behind us. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###She hasn't had a chance to stretch her wings for ages.'' 
###CHAR19### handed the hairpin to ###CHAR68### and, a moment later, ###CHAR33### soared joyfully out of the window to glide alongside them like a ghost. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``So - what's the story, ###CHAR68###?'' 
said ###CHAR68### impatiently. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What's been happening?'' 
###CHAR68### told them all about ###CHAR48###, the warning ###CHAR68###'d given ###CHAR68### and the fiasco of the violet pudding. 
There was a long, shocked silence when ###CHAR68### had finished. 
###DIALOGUE###``Very fishy,'' said ###CHAR55### finally. 
###DIALOGUE###``Definitely dodgy'' agreed ###CHAR19###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``So ###CHAR68### wouldn't even tell you who's supposed to be plotting all this stuff?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``I don't think ###CHAR68### could,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I told you, every time ###CHAR68### got close to letting something slip, ###CHAR68### started banging ###CHAR68###'s head against the wall.'' 
###CHAR68### saw ###CHAR55### and ###CHAR19### look at each other. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What, you think ###CHAR68### was lying to me?'' 
said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Well,'' said ###CHAR55###, ``put it this way - house-elves have got powerful magic of their own, but they can't usually use it without their master's permission. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I reckon old ###CHAR48### was sent to stop you com ing back to Hogwarts. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Someone's idea of a joke. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Can you think of anyone at school with a grudge against you?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Yes,'' said ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### together, instantly. 
###DIALOGUE###``Draco Malfoy,'' ###CHAR68### explained. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``He hates me.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Draco Malfoy?'' 
said ###CHAR19###, turning around. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Not ###CHAR50### 's son?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Must be, it's not a very common name, is it?'' 
said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``I've heard Dad talking about him,'' said ###CHAR19###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``He was a big supporter of You-Know-Who.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``And when You-Know-Who disappeared,'' said ###CHAR55###, craning around to look at ###CHAR68###, ``###CHAR50### came back saying ###CHAR50###'d never meant any of it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Load of dung - Dad reckons he was right in You- ###CHAR37###'s inner circle.'' 
###CHAR68### had heard these rumors about ###CHAR50###'s family before, and they didn't surprise ###CHAR68### at all. 
###CHAR50### made Dudley Dursley look like a kind, thoughtful, and sensitive boy. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I don't know whether the ###CHAR30### own a house-elf said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Well, whoever owns ###CHAR68### will be an old wizarding family, and they'll be rich,'' said ###CHAR55###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Yeah, Mum's always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing,'' said ###CHAR19###. 
###DIALOGUE###``But all we've got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all over the garden. 
###DIALOGUE###House-elves come with big old manors and castles and places like that; you wouldn't catch one in our house ...'' ###CHAR68### was silent. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Judging by the fact that ###CHAR0### usually had the best of everything, ###CHAR0###'s family was rolling in wizard gold; ###CHAR0### could just see ###CHAR50### strutting around a large manor house. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Sending the family servant to stop ###CHAR68### from going back to Hogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of thing Malfoy would do. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Had Harry been stupid to take ###CHAR48### seriously? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I'm glad we came to get you, anyway,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``I was getting really worried when you didn't answer any of my letters. 
###DIALOGUE###I thought it was ###CHAR74###'s fault at first -'' ``Who's ###CHAR74###?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Our owl. 
###CHAR74###'s ancient. 
It wouldn't be the first time ###CHAR74###'d collapsed on a delivery. 
###DIALOGUE###So then I tried to borrow Hermes -'' ``Who?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``The owl Mum and Dad bought ###CHAR70### when he was made prefect,'' said ###CHAR55### from the front. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But ###CHAR70### wouldn't lend ###CHAR70### to me,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Said he needed him.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Percy's been acting very oddly this summer,'' said ###CHAR19###, frowning. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``And he has been sending a lot of letters and spending a load of time shut up in his room ... I mean, there's only so many times you can polish a prefect badge ... You're driving too far west, ###CHAR55###,'' ###CHAR19### added, pointing at a compass on the dashboard. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR55### twiddled the steering wheel. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``So, does your dad know you've got the car?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68###, guessing the answer. 
###DIALOGUE###``Er, no,'' said ###CHAR68###, ``he had to work tonight. 
###DIALOGUE###Hopefully we'll be able to get it back in the garage without Mum noticing we flew it.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What does your dad do at the ###CHAR89### , anyway?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``He works in the most boring department,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``The Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``The what?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``It's all to do with bewitching things that are Muggle-made, you know, in case they end up back in a Muggle shop or house. 
Like, last year, some old witch died and her tea set was sold to an antiques shop. 
This Muggle woman bought it, took it home, and tried to serve her friends tea in it. 
###DIALOGUE###It was a nightmare - Dad was working overtime for weeks.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What happened?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``The teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all over the place and one man ended up in the hospital with the sugar tongs clamped to his nose. 
###DIALOGUE###Dad was going frantic - it's only him and an old warlock called Perkins in the office -and they had to do Memory Charms and all sorts of stuff to cover it up -'' ``But your dad - this car -'' ###CHAR55### laughed. 
###DIALOGUE###``Yeah, Dad's crazy about everything to do with ###CHAR7###; our shed's full of Muggle stuff. 
He takes it apart, puts spells on it, and puts it back together again. 
If he raided our house he'd have to put himself under arrest. 
###DIALOGUE###It drives Mum mad.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``That's the main road,'' said ###CHAR19###, peering down through the windshield. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We'll be there in ten minutes ... Just as well, it's getting light ...'' A faint pinkish glow was visible along the horizon to the east. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR55### brought the car lower, and ###CHAR68### saw a dark patchwork of fields and clumps of trees. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We're a little way outside the village,'' said ###CHAR19###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Ottery St. Catchpole.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Lower and lower went the flying car. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The edge of a brilliant red sun was now gleaming through the trees. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Touchdown!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR55### as, with a slight bump, they hit the ground. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard, and ###CHAR68### looked out for the first time at ###CHAR68###'s house. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It looked as though it had once been a large stone pigpen, but extra rooms had been added here and there until it was several stories high and so crooked it looked as though it were held up by magic -LRB-which, ###CHAR68### reminded himself, it probably was-RRB-. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Four or five chimneys were perched on top of the red roof. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###A lopsided sign stuck in the ground near the entrance read, THE BuRRow. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Around the front door lay a jumble of rubber boots and a very rusty cauldron. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Several fat brown chickens were pecking their way around the yard. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It's not much,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It's wonderful,'' said ###CHAR68### happily, thinking of Privet Drive. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They got out of the car. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Now, we'll go upstairs really quietly,'' said ###CHAR55###, ``and wait for Mum to call us for breakfast Then, ###CHAR68###, you come bounding downstairs going, `Mum, look who turned up in the night!' 
###DIALOGUE###and she'll be all pleased to see ###CHAR68### and no one need ever know we flew the car.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Right,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``Come on, ###CHAR68###, I sleep at the - at the top ###CHAR68### had gone a nasty greenish color, ###CHAR68###'s eyes fixed on the house. 
The other three wheeled around. 
###CHAR83### was marching across the yard, scattering chickens, and for a short, plump, kind-faced woman, it was remarkable how much she looked like a saber-toothed tiger. 
###DIALOGUE###``Ah, ``said ###CHAR55###. 
###DIALOGUE###``Oh, dear,'' said ###CHAR19###. 
###CHAR83### came to a halt in front of them, ###CHAR83###'s hands on ###CHAR83###'s hips, staring from one guilty face to the next. 
###CHAR83### was wearing a flowered apron with a wand sticking out of the pocket. 
###DIALOGUE###``So, ``she said. 
###DIALOGUE###``Morning, Mum,'' said ###CHAR19###, in what ###CHAR19### clearly thought was a jaunty, winning voice. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Have you any idea how worried I've been?'' 
said ###CHAR83### in a deadly whisper. 
###DIALOGUE###``Sorry, Mum, but see, we had to -'' All three of ###CHAR83### 's sons were taller than ###CHAR83### was, but they cowered as ###CHAR83###'s rage broke over them. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Beds empty! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###No note! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Cargone - could have crashed - out of my mind with worry - did you care? 
###DIALOGUE###- never, as long as I've lived - you wait until your father gets home, we never had trouble like this from ###CHAR13### or Charlie or Percy -'' ``Perfect Percy,'' muttered ###CHAR55###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``YOU COULD DO WITH TAKING A LEAF OUT OF PERCY'S BOOK!'' 
yelled ###CHAR83### , prodding a finger in ###CHAR55###'s chest. 
###DIALOGUE###``You could have died, you could have been seen, you could have lost your father his job -'' It seemed to go on for hours. 
###CHAR83### had shouted herself hoarse before ###CHAR83### turned on ###CHAR68###, who backed away. 
###DIALOGUE###``I'm very pleased to see you, ###CHAR68###, dear,'' ###CHAR83### said. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Come in and have some breakfast.'' 
###CHAR83### turned and walked back into the house and ###CHAR68###, after a nervous glance at ###CHAR68###, who nodded encouragingly, followed ###CHAR83###. 
The kitchen was small and rather cramped. 
There was a scrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle, and ###CHAR68### sat down on the edge of ###CHAR68###'s seat, looking around. 
###CHAR68### had never been in a wizard house before. 
The clock on the wall opposite ###CHAR68### had only one hand and no numbers at all. 
Written around the edge were things like Time to make tea, Time to feed the chickens, and You're late. 
Books were stacked three deep on the mantelpiece, books with titles like Charm Your Own Cheese, Enchantment in Baking, and One Minute Feasts - It's Magic! 
###DIALOGUE###And unless ###CHAR68###'s ears were deceiving ###CHAR68###, the old radio next to the sink had just announced that coming up was ``Witching Hour, with the popular singing sorceress, Celestina Warbeck.'' 
###CHAR83### was clattering around, cooking breakfast a little haphazardly, throwing dirty looks at ###CHAR83###'s sons as ###CHAR83### threw sausages into the frying pan. 
###DIALOGUE###Every now and then ###CHAR83### muttered things like ``don't know what you were thinking of,'' and ``never would have believed it.'' 
###DIALOGUE###``I don't blame you, dear,'' ###CHAR83### assured ###CHAR68###, tipping eight or nine sausages onto ###CHAR68###'s plate. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR64### and I have been worried about you, too. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Just last night we were saying we'd come and get you ourselves if you hadn't written back to ###CHAR68### by Friday. 
###DIALOGUE###But really,'' -LRB-###CHAR83### was now adding three fried eggs to ###CHAR68###'s plate-RRB- ``flying an illegal car halfway across the country - anyone could have seen you -'' ###CHAR83### flicked ###CHAR83###'s wand casually at the dishes in the sink, which began to clean themselves, clinking gently in the background. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It was cloudy, Mum!'' 
said ###CHAR55###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You keep your mouth closed while you're eating!'' 
###CHAR83### snapped. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``They were starving ###CHAR68###, Mum!'' 
said ###CHAR19###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``And you!'' 
said ###CHAR83### , but it was with a slightly softened expression that ###CHAR83### started cutting ###CHAR68### bread and buttering it for ###CHAR68###. 
At that moment there was a diversion in the form of a small, redheaded figure in a long nightdress, who appeared in the kitchen, gave a small squeal, and ran out again. 
###DIALOGUE###``###CHAR76###,'' said ###CHAR68### in an undertone to ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``My sister. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR76###'s been talking about you all summer.'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Yeah, ###CHAR76###'ll be wanting your autograph, ###CHAR68###,'' ###CHAR55### said with a grin, but ###CHAR55### caught ###CHAR55###'s mother's eye and bent ###CHAR55###'s face over ###CHAR55###'s plate without another word. 
Nothing more was said until all four plates were clean, which took a surprisingly short time. 
###DIALOGUE###``Blimey, I'm tired,'' yawned ###CHAR55###, setting down ###CHAR55###'s knife and fork at last. 
###DIALOGUE###``I think I'll go to bed and -'' ``You will not,'' snapped ###CHAR83### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It's your own fault you've been up all night. 
###DIALOGUE###You're going to de-gnome the garden for me; they're getting completely out of hand again -'' ``Oh, Mum -'' ``And you two,'' ###CHAR83### said, glaring at ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR55###. 
###DIALOGUE###``You can go up to bed, dear,'' ###CHAR83### added to ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You didn't ask them to fly that wretched car -'' But ###CHAR68###, who felt wide awake, said quickly, ``I'll help ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###I've never seen a de-gnoming -'' ``That's very sweet of you, dear, but it's dull work,'' said ###CHAR83### . 
###DIALOGUE###``Now, let's see what ###CHAR73###'s got to say on the subject -'' And ###CHAR83### pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece. 
###CHAR19### groaned. 
###DIALOGUE###``Mum, we know how to de-gnome a garden -'' ###CHAR68### looked at the cover of ###CHAR83### 's book. 
Written across it in fancy gold letters were the words ###CHAR73### 's Guide to Household Pests. 
There was a big photograph on the front of a very good- IOI-RRB-king wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes. 
As always in the wizarding world, the photograph was moving; the wizard, who ###CHAR68### supposed was ###CHAR73### , kept winking cheekily up at them all. 
###CHAR83### beamed down at ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``Oh, ###CHAR73### is marvelous,'' ###CHAR83### said. 
###DIALOGUE###``###CHAR73### knows ###CHAR73###'s household pests, all right, it's a wonderful book ...'' ``Mum fancies ###CHAR73###,'' said ###CHAR55###, in a very audible whisper. 
###DIALOGUE###``Don't be so ridiculous, ###CHAR55###,'' said ###CHAR83### , ###CHAR83###'s cheeks rather pink. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``All right, if you think you know better than ###CHAR73###, you can go and get on with it, and woe betide you if there's a single gnome in that garden when I come out to inspect it.'' 
Yawning and grumbling, the Weasleys slouched outside with ###CHAR68### behind them. 
The garden was large, and in ###CHAR68###'s eyes, exactlY what a garden should be. 
The Dursleys wouldn't have liked it - there were plenty of weeds, and the grass needed cutting but there were gnarled trees all around the walls, plants ###CHAR68### had never seen spilling from every flower bed, and a big green pond full of frogs. 
###DIALOGUE###``Muggles have garden gnomes, too, you know,'' ###CHAR68### told ###CHAR68### they crossed the lawn. 
###DIALOGUE###``Yeah, I've seen those things they think are gnomes,'' said ###CHAR68###, bent double with ###CHAR68###'s head in a peony ###CHAR75###, ``like fat little Santa Clauses with fishing rods ...'' There was a violent scuffling noise, the peony ###CHAR75### shuddered, and ###CHAR68### straightened up. 
###DIALOGUE###``This is a gnome,'' ###CHAR68### said grimly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Gerroff me! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Gerroff me!'' 
squealed the gnome. 
It was certainly nothing like Santa Claus. 
It was small and leathery looking, with a large, knobby, bald head exactly like a potato. 
###CHAR68### held it at arm's length as it kicked out at ###CHAR68### with its horny little feet; ###CHAR68### grasped it around the ankles and turned it upside down. 
###DIALOGUE###``This is what you have to do,'' ###CHAR68### said. 
###CHAR68### raised the gnome above ###CHAR68###'s head -LRB-``Gerroff me!''-RRB- 
and started to swing it in great circles like a lasso. 
###DIALOGUE###Seeing the shocked look on ###CHAR68###'s face, ###CHAR68### added, ``It doesn't hurt them - you've just got to make them really dizzy so they can't find their way back to the gnomeholes.'' 
###CHAR68### let go of the gnome's ankles: It flew twenty feet into the air and landed with a thud in the field over the hedge. 
###DIALOGUE###``Pitiful,'' said ###CHAR55###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I bet I can get mine beyond that stump.'' 
###CHAR68### learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes. 
###CHAR68### decided just to drop the first one ###CHAR68### caught over the hedge, but the gnome, sensing weakness, sank its razor-sharp teeth into ###CHAR68###'s finger and ###CHAR68### had a hard job shaking it off - until ``Wow, ###CHAR68### - that must've been fifty feet ...'' The air was soon thick with flying gnomes. 
###DIALOGUE###``See, they're not too bright,'' said ###CHAR19###, seizing five or six gnomes at once. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``The moment they know the de-gnoming's going on they storm up to have a look. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###You'd think they'd have learned by now just to stay put.'' 
Soon, the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in a straggling line, their little shoulders hunched. 
###DIALOGUE###``They'll be back,'' said ###CHAR68### as they watched the gnomes disappear into the hedge on the other side of the field. 
###DIALOGUE###``They love it here ... Dad's too soft with them; he thinks they're funny ...'' Just then, the front door slammed. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``He's back!'' 
said ###CHAR19###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Dad's home!'' 
They hurried through the garden and back into the house. 
###CHAR84### was slumped in a kitchen chair with ###CHAR84###'s glasses off and ###CHAR84###'s eyes closed. 
###CHAR84### was a thin man, going bald, but the little hair ###CHAR84### had was as red as any of ###CHAR84###'s children's. 
###CHAR84### was wearing long green robes, which were dusty and travel-worn. 
###DIALOGUE###``What a night,'' ###CHAR84### mumbled, groping for the teapot as they all sat down around ###CHAR84###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Nine raids. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Nine! 
###DIALOGUE###And old Mundungus Fletcher tried to put a hex on me when I had my back turned ...'' ###CHAR84### took a long gulp of tea and sighed. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Find anything, Dad?'' 
said ###CHAR55### eagerly. 
###DIALOGUE###``All I got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle,'' yawned ###CHAR84### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``There was some pretty nasty stuff that wasn't my department, though. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Mortlake was taken away for questioning about some extremely odd ferrets, but that's the Committee on Experimental Charms, thank goodness ...'' ``Why would anyone bother making door keys shrink?'' 
said ###CHAR19###. 
###DIALOGUE###``Just Muggle-baiting,'' sighed ###CHAR84### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Sell them a key that keeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need it ... Of course, it's very hard to convict anyone because no Muggle would admit their key keeps shrinking - they'll insist they just keep losing it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Bless them, they'll go to any lengths to ignore magic, even if it's staring them in the face ... But the things our lot have taken to enchanting, you wouldn't believe -'' ``LIKE CARS, FOR INSTANCE?'' 
###CHAR83### had appeared, holding a long poker like a sword. 
###CHAR84### 's eyes jerked open. 
###CHAR84### stared guiltily at ###CHAR84###'s wife. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``C-cars, ###CHAR9###, dear?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Yes, ###CHAR64###, cars,'' said ###CHAR83### , ###CHAR83###'s eyes flashing. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Imagine a wizard buying a rusty old car and telling ###CHAR64###'s wife all ###CHAR64### wanted to do with it was take it apart to see how it worked, while really ###CHAR64### was enchanting it to make it fly.'' 
###CHAR84### blinked. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Well, dear, I think you'll find that ###CHAR64### would be quite within the law to do that, even if - er - ###CHAR64### maybe would have done better to, um, tell ###CHAR64###'s wife the truth ... There's a loophole in the law, you'll find ... As long as ###CHAR64### wasn't intending to fly the car, the fact that the car could fly wouldn't -'' ``###CHAR64### , you made sure there was a loophole when you wrote that law!'' 
shouted ###CHAR83### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Just so you could carry on tinkering with all that Muggle rubbish in your shed! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###And for your information, ###CHAR68### arrived this morning in the car you weren't intending to fly!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR68###?'' 
said ###CHAR84### blankly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Harry who?'' 
###CHAR84### looked around, saw ###CHAR68###, and jumped. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Good lord, is it ###CHAR54### ? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Very pleased to meet you, ###CHAR68###'s told us so much about -'' ``Your sons flew that car to ###CHAR68###'s house and back last night.'' 
shouted ###CHAR83### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What have you got to say about that, eh?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Did you really?'' 
said ###CHAR84### eagerly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Did it go all right? 
###DIALOGUE###I - I mean,'' ###CHAR84### faltered as sparks flew from ###CHAR83### 's eyes, ``that - that was very wrong, boys - very wrong indeed ...'' ``Let's leave them to it,'' ###CHAR68### muttered to ###CHAR68### as ###CHAR83### swelled like a bullfrog. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Come on, I'll show you my bedroom.'' 
They slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow passageway to an uneven staircase, which wound its way, zigzagging up through the house. 
On the third landing, a door stood ajar. 
###CHAR68### just caught sight of a pair of bright brown eyes staring at ###CHAR68### before it closed with a snap. 
###DIALOGUE###``###CHAR76###,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You don't know how weird it is for ###CHAR76###'s to be this shy. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR76### never shuts up normally -'' They climbed two more flights until they reached a door with peeling paint and a small plaque on it, saying RONALD'S ROOM. 
###CHAR68### stepped in, ###CHAR68###'s head almost touching the sloping ceiling, and blinked. 
It was like walking into a furnace: Nearly everything in ###CHAR68###'s room seemed to be a violent shade of orange: the bedspread, the walls, even the ceiling. 
Then ###CHAR68### realized that ###CHAR68### had covered nearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the same seven witches and wizards, all wearing bright orange robes, carrying broomsticks, and waving energetically. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Your Quidditch team?'' 
said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``The Chudley Cannons,'' said ###CHAR68###, pointing at the orange bedspread, which was emblazoned with two giant black C's and a speeding cannonball. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Ninth in the league.'' 
###CHAR68###'s school spellbooks were stacked untidily in a corner, next to a pile of comics that all seemed to feature The Adventures of Martin Miggs, the Mad Muggle. 
###CHAR68###'s magic wand was lying on top of a fish tank full of frog spawn on the windowsill, next to ###CHAR68###'s fat gray rat, Scabbers, who was snoozing in a patch of sun. 
###CHAR68### stepped over a pack of Self-Shuffling playing cards on the floor and looked out of the tiny window. 
In the field far below ###CHAR68### could see a gang of gnomes sneaking one by one back through the Weasleys' hedge. 
Then ###CHAR68### turned to look at ###CHAR68###, who was watching ###CHAR68### almost nervously, as though waiting for ###CHAR68###'s opinion. 
###DIALOGUE###``It's a bit small,'' said ###CHAR68### quickly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Not like that room you had with the Muggles. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###And I'm right underneath the ghoul in the attic; he's always banging on the pipes and groaning ...'' But ###CHAR68###, grinning widely, said, ``This is the best house I've ever been in.'' 
###CHAR68###'s ears went pink.
FLOURISH AND BLOTTS
Life at the Burrow was as different as possible from life on Privet Drive. 
The ###CHAR88### liked everything neat and ordered; the Weasleys' house burst with the strange and unexpected. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR68### got a shock the first time ###CHAR68### looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it shouted, ``Tuck your shirt in, scruffy!'' 
The ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet, and small explosions from ###CHAR55### and ###CHAR19###'s bedroom were considered perfectly normal. 
What ###CHAR68### found most unusual about life at ###CHAR68###'s, however, wasn't the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul: It was the fact that everybody there seemed to like ###CHAR68###. 
###CHAR83### fussed over the state of ###CHAR68###'s socks and tried to force ###CHAR68### to eat fourth helpings at every meal. 
###CHAR84### liked ###CHAR68### to sit next to ###CHAR68### at the dinner table so that ###CHAR68### could bombard ###CHAR68### with questions about life with ###CHAR7###, asking ###CHAR68### to explain how things like plugs and the postal service worked. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Fascinating.'' 
###CHAR68### would say as ###CHAR68### talked ###CHAR68### through using a telephone. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Ingenious, really, how many ways Muggles have found of getting along without magic.'' 
###CHAR68### heard from ###CHAR26### one sunny morning about a week after ###CHAR68### had arrived at the Burrow. 
###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### went down to breakfast to find Mr. and ###CHAR83### and ###CHAR76### already sitting at the kitchen table. 
The moment ###CHAR83### saw ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR76### accidentally knocked ###CHAR83###'s porridge bowl to the floor with a loud clatter. 
###CHAR76### seemed very prone to knocking things over whenever ###CHAR68### entered a room. 
###CHAR76### dived under the table to retrieve the bowl and emerged with ###CHAR76###'s face glowing like the setting sun. 
Pretending ###CHAR68### hadn't noticed this, ###CHAR68### sat down and took the toast ###CHAR83### offered ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``Letters from school,'' said ###CHAR84### , passing ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### identical envelopes of yellowish parchment, addressed in green ink. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR94### already knows you're here, ###CHAR68### - doesn't miss a trick, that man. 
###DIALOGUE###You two've got them, too,'' ###CHAR68### added, as ###CHAR55### and ###CHAR19### ambled in, still in their pajamas. 
For a few minutes there was silence as they all read their letters. 
###CHAR68###'s told ###CHAR68### to catch the ###CHAR62### as usual from King's Cross station on September first. 
There was also a list of the new books ###CHAR68###'d need for the coming year.
SECOND-YEAR STUDENTS WILL REQUIRE:
The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 by Miranda Goshawk Break with a Banshee by Gilderoy Lockhart Gadding with Ghouls by Gilderoy Lockhart Holidays with Hags by ###CHAR73### Travels with Trolls by ###CHAR73### Voyages with Vampires by Gilderoy Lockhart Wanderings with Werewolves by ###CHAR73### Year with the Yeti by Gilderoy Lockhart
Fred, who had finished his own list, peered over at ###CHAR68###'s. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You've been told to get all ###CHAR73###'s books, too!'' 
###CHAR68### said. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``The new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher must be a fan - bet it's a witch.'' 
At this point, ###CHAR55### caught ###CHAR55###'s mother's eye and quickly busied himself with the marmalade. 
###DIALOGUE###``That lot won't come cheap,'' said ###CHAR19###, with a quick look at ###CHAR19###'s parents. 
###DIALOGUE###``###CHAR73###'s books are really expensive ...'' ``Well, we'll manage,'' said ###CHAR83### , but ###CHAR83### looked worried. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I expect we'll be able to pick up a lot of ###CHAR76###'s things secondhand.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Oh, are you starting at Hogwarts this year?'' 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR68### asked ###CHAR76###. 
###CHAR76### nodded, blushing to the roots of ###CHAR76###'s flaming hair, and put ###CHAR76###'s elbow in the butter dish. 
Fortunately no one saw this except ###CHAR68###, because just then ###CHAR68###'s elder brother ###CHAR70### walked in. 
###CHAR70### was already dressed, ###CHAR70### ###CHAR26### prefect badge pinned to ###CHAR70###'s sweater vest. 
###DIALOGUE###``Morning, all,'' said ###CHAR70### briskly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Lovely day.'' 
###CHAR70### sat down in the only remaining chair but leapt up again almost immediately, pulling from underneath ###CHAR70### a moulting, gray feather duster - at least, that was what ###CHAR68### thought it was, until ###CHAR68### saw that it was breathing. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Errol!'' 
said ###CHAR68###, taking the limp owl from ###CHAR70### and extracting a letter from under its wing. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Finally - he's got ###CHAR25###'s answer. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I wrote to ###CHAR25###'s saying we were going to try and rescue you from the ###CHAR88###.'' 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR70### carried ###CHAR74### to a perch just inside the back door and tried to stand ###CHAR70### on it, but ###CHAR74### flopped straight off again so ###CHAR68### lay ###CHAR68### on the draining board instead, muttering, ``Pathetic.'' 
Then ###CHAR68### ripped open ###CHAR25###'s letter and read it out loud: ''`Dear ###CHAR68###, and ###CHAR68### if you're there, ''`I hope everything went all right and that ###CHAR68### is okay and that you didn't do anything illegal to get ###CHAR68### out, ###CHAR68###, because that would get ###CHAR68### into trouble, too. 
###DIALOGUE###I've been really worried and if ###CHAR68### is all right, will you please let me know at once, but perhaps it would be bet ter if you used a different owl because I think another delivery might finish your one off. ''
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###`I'm very busy with schoolwork, of course'- How can she be?'' 
said ###CHAR68### in horror. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We're on vacation! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###- `and we're going to London next Wednesday to buy my new books. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Why don't we meet in Diago n ###CHAR59###? ''
###DIALOGUE###`Let me know what's happening as soon as you can. 
###DIALOGUE###Love from ###CHAR25###. ''' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Well, that fits in nicely, we can go and get all your things then, too,'' said ###CHAR83### , starting to clear the table. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What're you all up to today?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###, ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR55###, and ###CHAR19### were planning to go up the hill to a small paddock the Weasleys owned. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It was surrounded by trees that blocked it from view of the village below, meaning that they could practice Quidditch there, as long as they didn't fly too high. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They couldn't use real Quidditch balls, which would have been hard to explain if they had escaped and flown away over the village; instead they threw apples for one another to catch. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They took turns riding ###CHAR68###'s Nimbus Two Thousand, which was easily the best broom; ###CHAR68###'s old Shooting Star was often outstripped by passing butterflies. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Five minutes later they were marching up the hill, broomsticks over their shoulders. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They had asked ###CHAR70### if ###CHAR70### wanted to join them, but ###CHAR70### had said ###CHAR70### was busy. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### had only seen ###CHAR70### at mealtimes so far; ###CHAR68### stayed shut in ###CHAR68###'s room the rest of the time. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Wish I knew what he was up to,'' said ###CHAR55###, frowning. 
###DIALOGUE###``He's not himself. 
###DIALOGUE###His exam results came the day before you did; twelve O.WL.s and he hardly gloated at all.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Ordinary Wizarding Levels,'' ###CHAR19### explained, seeing ###CHAR68###'s puzzled look. 
###DIALOGUE###``Bill got twelve, too. 
If we're not careful, we'll have another Head Boy in the family. 
###DIALOGUE###I don't think I could stand the shame.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR13### was the oldest ###CHAR55### brother. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR13### and the next brother, ###CHAR49###, had already left ###CHAR26###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### had never met either of them, but knew that ###CHAR49### was in Romania studying dragons and ###CHAR13### in Egypt working for the wizard's bank, ###CHAR39###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Dunno how Mum and Dad are going to afford all our school stuff this year,'' said ###CHAR19### after a while. 
###DIALOGUE###``Five sets of Lockhart books! 
###DIALOGUE###And ###CHAR76### needs robes and a wand and everything ...'' ###CHAR68### said nothing. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### felt a bit awkward. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Stored in an underground vault at Gringotts in London was a small fortune that ###CHAR68###'s parents had left ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Of course, it was only in the wizarding world that ###CHAR68### had money; you couldn't use Galleons, Sickles, and Knuts in Muggle shops. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### had never mentioned ###CHAR68### ###CHAR39### bank account to the ###CHAR88###; ###CHAR68### didn't think their horror of anything connected with magic would stretch to a large pile of gold. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR83### woke them all early the following Wednesday. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###After a quick half a dozen bacon sandwiches each, they pulled on their coats and ###CHAR83### took a flowerpot off the kitchen mantelpiece and peered inside. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We're running low, ###CHAR64###,'' ###CHAR83### sighed. 
###DIALOGUE###``We'll have to buy some more today... Ah well, guests first! 
###DIALOGUE###After you, ###CHAR68### dear!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###And ###CHAR83### offered ###CHAR68### the flowerpot. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### stared at them all watching ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``W-what am I supposed to do?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### stammered. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR68###'s never traveled by Floo powder,'' said ###CHAR68### suddenly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Sorry, ###CHAR68###, I forgot.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Never?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR84### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But how did you get to Diagon Alley to buy your school things last year?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I went on the Underground -'' ``Really?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR84### eagerly. 
###DIALOGUE###``Were there escapators? 
###DIALOGUE###How exactly -'' ``Not now, ###CHAR64###,'' said ###CHAR83### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Floo powder's a lot quicker, dear, but goodness me, if you've never used it before -'' ``###CHAR64###'ll be all right, Mum,'' said ###CHAR55###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR68###, watch us first.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR84### took a pinch of glittering powder out of the flowerpot, stepped up to the fire, and threw the powder into the flames. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###With a roar, the fire turned emerald green and rose higher than ###CHAR55###, who stepped right into it, shouted, ``Diagon Alley!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###and vanished. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You must speak clearly, dear,'' ###CHAR83### told ###CHAR68### as ###CHAR19### dipped ###CHAR68###'s hand into the flowerpot. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``And be sure to get out at the right grate ...'' ``The right what?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68### nervously as the fire roared and whipped ###CHAR19### out of sight, too. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Well, there are an awful lot of wizard fires to choose from, you know, but as long as you've spoken clearly -'' ``He'll be fine, ###CHAR9###, don't fuss,'' said ###CHAR84### , helping himself to Floo powder, too. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But, dear, if he got lost, how would we ever explain to his aunt and uncle?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``They wouldn't mind,'' ###CHAR68### reassured ###CHAR83###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR1### would think it was a brilliant joke if I got lost up a chimney, don't worry about that -'' ``Well ... all right ... you go after ###CHAR64###,'' said ###CHAR83### . 
###DIALOGUE###``Now, when you get into the fire, say where you're going ``And keep your elbows tucked in,'' ###CHAR68### advised. 
###DIALOGUE###``And your eyes shut,'' said ###CHAR83### . 
###DIALOGUE###``The soot -'' ``Don't fidget,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Or you might well fall out of the wrong fireplace -'' ``But don't panic and get out too early; wait until you see ###CHAR55### and ###CHAR19###.'' 
Trying hard to bear all this in mind, ###CHAR68### took a pinch of Floo powder and walked to the edge of the fire. 
###CHAR68### took a deep breath, scattered the powder into the flames, and stepped forward; the fire felt like a warm breeze; ###CHAR68### opened ###CHAR68###'s mouth and immediately swallowed a lot of hot ash. 
###DIALOGUE###``D-Dia-gon ###CHAR59###,'' ###CHAR68### coughed. 
It felt as though ###CHAR68### was being sucked down a giant drain. 
###CHAR68### seemed to be spinning very fast - the roaring in ###CHAR68###'s ears was deafening -###CHAR68### tried to keep ###CHAR68###'s eyes open but the whirl of green flames made ###CHAR68### feel sick - something hard knocked ###CHAR68###'s elbow and ###CHAR68### tucked it in tightly, still spinning and spinning - now it felt as though cold hands were slapping ###CHAR68###'s face - squinting through ###CHAR68###'s glasses ###CHAR68### saw a blurred stream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the rooms beyond - ###CHAR68###'s bacon sandwiches were churning inside ###CHAR68### - ###CHAR68### closed ###CHAR68###'s eyes again wishing it would stop, and then ###CHAR68### fell, face forward, onto cold stone and felt the bridge of ###CHAR68###'s glasses snap. 
Dizzy and bruised, covered in soot, ###CHAR68### got gingerly to ###CHAR68###'s feet, holding ###CHAR68###'s broken glasses up to ###CHAR68###'s eyes. 
###CHAR68### was -,cite alone, but where ###CHAR68### was, ###CHAR68### had no idea. 
All ###CHAR68### could tell was that ###CHAR68### was standing in the stone fireplace of what looked like a large, dimly lit wizard's shop - but nothing in here was ever likely to be on a ###CHAR26### school list. 
A glass case nearby held a withered hand on a cushion, a bloodstained pack of cards, and a staring glass eye. 
Evil-looking masks stared down from the walls, an assortment of human bones lay upon the counter, and rusty, spiked instruments hung from the ceiling. 
Even worse, the dark, narrow street ###CHAR68### could see through the dusty shop window was definitely not Diagon Alley. 
The sooner ###CHAR68### got out of here, the better. 
Nose still stinging where it had hit the hearth, ###CHAR68### made ###CHAR68###'s way swiftly and silently toward the door, but before ###CHAR68###'d got halfway toward it, two people appeared on the other side of the glass - and one of them was the very last person ###CHAR68### wanted to meet when ###CHAR68### was lost, covered in soot, and wearing broken glasses: ###CHAR0### . 
Harry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to his left; he shot inside it and pulled the doors closed, leaving a small crack to peer through. 
Seconds later, a bell clanged, and ###CHAR50### stepped into the shop. 
The man who followed could only be ###CHAR0###'s father. 
###CHAR0### had the same pale, pointed face and identical cold, gray eyes. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR50### crossed the shop, looking lazily at the items on display, and rang a bell on the counter before turning to ###CHAR50###'s son and saying, ``Touch nothing, Draco.'' 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR50###, who had reached for the glass eye, said, ``I thought you were going to buy me a present.'' 
###DIALOGUE###``I said I would buy you a racing broom,'' said ###CHAR50###'s father, drumming ###CHAR50###'s fingers on the counter. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What's the good of that if I'm not on the House team?'' 
said ###CHAR50###, looking sulky and bad-tempered. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR54### got a Nimbus Two Thousand last year. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Special permission from ###CHAR94### so ###CHAR94### could play for Gryffindor. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR94###'s not even that good, it's just because ###CHAR94###'s famous ... famous for having a stupid scar on ###CHAR94###'s forehead ...'' ###CHAR50### bent down to examine a shelf full of skulls. ''
###DIALOGUE###... everyone thinks ###CHAR50###'s so smart, wonderful ###CHAR54### with ###CHAR54###'s scar and ###CHAR54###'s broomstick -'' ``You have told me this at least a dozen times already,'' said ###CHAR50### , with a quelling look at ###CHAR50###'s son. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``And I would remind you that it is not - prudent - to appear less than fond of ###CHAR54### , not when most of our kind regard ###CHAR54### as the hero who made the Dark Lord disappear - ah, ###CHAR18### .'' 
A stooping man had appeared behind the counter, smoothing ###CHAR50###'s greasy hair back from ###CHAR50###'s face. 
###DIALOGUE###``###CHAR50### , what a pleasure to see you again,'' said ###CHAR18### in a voice as oily as ###CHAR18###'s hair. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Delighted - and young Master Malfoy, too - charmed. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###How may I be of assistance? 
###DIALOGUE###I must show you, just in today, and very reasonably priced -'' ``I'm not buying today, ###CHAR18### , but selling,'' said ###CHAR50### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Selling?'' 
The smile faded slightly from ###CHAR18### 's face. 
###DIALOGUE###``You have heard, of course, that the Ministry is conducting more raids,'' said ###CHAR50### , taking a roll of parchment from ###CHAR50###'s inside pocket and unraveling it for ###CHAR18### to read. 
###DIALOGUE###``I have a few - ah - items at home that might embarrass me, if the Ministry were to call ...'' ###CHAR18### fixed a pair of pince-nez to ###CHAR18###'s nose and looked down the list. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``The Ministry wouldn't presume to trouble you, sir, surely?'' 
###CHAR50### 's lip curled. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I have not been visited yet. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The name ###CHAR50### still commands a certain respect, yet the Ministry grows ever more meddlesome. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There are rumors about a new Muggle Protection Act - no doubt that fleabitten, Muggle-loving fool ###CHAR64### is behind it ###CHAR68### felt a hot surge of anger. ''
###DIALOGUE###- and as you see, certain of these poisons might make it appear -'' ``I understand, sir, of course,'' said ###CHAR18### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Let me see...'' ``Can I have that?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###interrupted ###CHAR0###, pointing at the withered hand on its cushion. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Ah, the Hand of Glory!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR18### , abandoning ###CHAR50### 's list and scurrying over to Draco. 
###DIALOGUE###``Insert a candle and it gives light only to the holder! 
Best friend of thieves and plunderers! 
###DIALOGUE###Your son has fine taste, sir.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer, Borgin,'' said ###CHAR50### coldly, and ###CHAR18### said quickly, ``No offense, sir, no offense meant -'' ``Though if his grades don't pick up,'' said ###CHAR50### , more coldly still, ``that may indeed be all he is fit for -'' ``It's not my fault,'' retorted ###CHAR0###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``The teachers all have favorites, that ###CHAR25### -'' ``I would have thought you'd be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family beat you in every exam,'' snapped ###CHAR50### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Ha!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68### under ###CHAR50###'s breath, pleased to see ###CHAR0### looking both abashed and angry. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It's the same all over,'' said ###CHAR18### , in ###CHAR18###'s oily voice. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Wizard blood is counting for less everywhere -'' ``Not with me,'' said ###CHAR50### , ###CHAR50###'s long nostrils flaring. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``No, sir, nor with me, sir,'' said ###CHAR18### , with a deep bow. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``In that case, perhaps we can return to my list,'' said ###CHAR50### shortly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I am in something of a hurry, Borgin, I have important business elsewhere today -'' They started to haggle. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### watched nervously as ###CHAR0### drew nearer and nearer to ###CHAR0###'s hiding place, examining the objects for sale. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR0### paused to examine a long coil of hangman's rope and to read, smirking, the card propped on a magnificent necklace of opals, Caution: Do Not Touch. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Cursed - Has Claimed the Lives of Nineteen Muggle Owners to Date. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR0### turned away and saw the cabinet right in front of ###CHAR0###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR0### walked forward - ###CHAR0### stretched out ###CHAR0###'s hand for the handle ``Done,'' said ###CHAR50### at the counter. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Come, ###CHAR0### -'' ###CHAR68### wiped ###CHAR68###'s forehead on ###CHAR68###'s sleeve as ###CHAR0### turned away. 
###DIALOGUE###``Good day to you, ###CHAR18### . 
###DIALOGUE###I'll expect you at the manor tomorrow to pick up the goods.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The moment the door had closed, ###CHAR18### dropped ###CHAR18###'s oily manner. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Good day yourself, Mister Malfoy, and if the stories are true, you haven't sold me half of what's hidden in your manor ...'' Muttering darkly, ###CHAR18### disappeared into a back room. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### waited for a minute in case ###CHAR68### came back, then, quietly as ###CHAR68### could, slipped out of the cabinet, past the glass cases, and out of the shop door. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Clutching ###CHAR68###'s broken glasses to ###CHAR68###'s face, ###CHAR68### stared around. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### had emerged into a dingy alleyway that seemed to be made up entirely of shops devoted to the Dark Arts. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The one ###CHAR68###'d just left, ###CHAR18### and Burkes, looked like the largest, but opposite was a nasty window display of shrunken heads and, two doors down, a large cage was alive with gigantic black spiders. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Two shabby-looking wizards were watching ###CHAR18### from the shadow of a doorway, muttering to each other. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Feeling jumpy, ###CHAR68### set off, trying to hold ###CHAR68###'s glasses on straight and hoping against hope ###CHAR68###'d be able to find a way out of here. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###An old wooden street sign hanging over a shop selling poisonous candles told ###CHAR68### was in Knockturn Alley. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###This didn't help, as ###CHAR68### had never heard of such a place. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### supposed ###CHAR68### hadn't spoken clearly enough through ###CHAR68###'s mouthful of ashes back in the Weasleys' fire. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Trying to stay calm, ###CHAR68### wondered what to do. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Not lost are you, my dear?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said a voice in ###CHAR68###'s ear, making ###CHAR68### jump. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###An aged witch stood in front of ###CHAR68###, holding a tray of what looked horribly like whole human fingernails. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###She leered at ###CHAR68###, showing mossy teeth. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### backed away. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I'm fine, thanks,'' ###CHAR68### said. 
###DIALOGUE###``I'm just -'' ``HARRY! 
###DIALOGUE###What d'yeh think yer doin' down there?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###'s heart leapt. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###So did the witch; a load of fingernails cascaded down over her feet and she cursed as the massive form of ###CHAR22###, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, came striding toward them, beetle-black eyes flashing over ###CHAR68###'s great bristling beard. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Hagrid!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### croaked in relief. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I was lost - Floo powder -'' ###CHAR22### seized ###CHAR68### by the scruff of the neck and pulled ###CHAR68### away from the witch, knocking the tray right out of her hands. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Her shrieks followed them all the way along the twisting alleyway out into bright sunlight. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### saw a familiar, snow-white marble building in the distance - Gringotts Bank. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR22### had steered ###CHAR68### right into Diagon Alley. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Yer a mess!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR22### gruffly, brushing soot off ###CHAR68### so forcefully ###CHAR68### nearly knocked ###CHAR68### into a barrel of dragon dung outside an apothecary. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Skulkin' around Knockturn Alley, I dunno dodgy place, ###CHAR68### - don' want no one ter see yeh down there -'' ``I realized that,'' said ###CHAR68###, ducking as ###CHAR22### made to brush ###CHAR68### off again. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I told you, I was lost - what were you doing down there, anyway?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I was lookin' fer a Flesh-Eatin' Slug Repellent,'' growled ###CHAR22###. 
###DIALOGUE###``They're ruinin' the school cabbages. 
###DIALOGUE###Yer not on yer own?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I'm staying with the Weasleys but we got separated,'' ###CHAR68### explained. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I've got to go and find them ...'' They set off together down the street. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``How come yeh never wrote back ter me?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR22### as ###CHAR68### jogged alongside ###CHAR68### -LRB-###CHAR68### had to take three steps to every stride of ###CHAR22###'s enormous boots-RRB-. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### explained all about ###CHAR48### and the ###CHAR88###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Lousy Muggles,'' growled ###CHAR22###. 
###DIALOGUE###``If I'd've known -'' ``Harry! 
###CHAR68###! 
###DIALOGUE###Over here!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### looked up and saw ###CHAR25### standing at the top of the white flight of steps to Gringotts. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR25### ran down to meet them, ###CHAR25###'s bushy brown hair flying behind ###CHAR25###. 
###DIALOGUE###``What happened to your glasses? 
###DIALOGUE###Hello, ###CHAR22### - Oh, it's wonderful to see you two again - Are you coming into Gringotts, ###CHAR68###?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``As soon as I've found the Weasleys,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Yeh won't have long ter wait,'' ###CHAR22### said with a grin. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### looked around: Sprinting up the crowded street were ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR55###, ###CHAR19###, ###CHAR70###, and ###CHAR84### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Harry,'' ###CHAR84### panted. 
###DIALOGUE###``We hoped you'd only gone one grate too far . 
He mopped his glistening bald patch. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Molly's frantic - she's coming now -'' ``Where did you come out?'' 
###CHAR68### asked. 
###DIALOGUE###``Knockturn Alley,'' said ###CHAR22### grimly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Excellent.'' 
said ###CHAR55### and ###CHAR19### together. 
###DIALOGUE###``We've never been allowed in,'' said ###CHAR68### enviously. 
###DIALOGUE###``I should ruddy well think not,'' growled ###CHAR22###. 
###CHAR83### now came galloping into view, ###CHAR83###'s handbag swing ing wildly in one hand, ###CHAR76### just clinging onto the other. 
###DIALOGUE###``Oh, ###CHAR68### - oh, my dear - you could have been any where -'' Gasping for breath ###CHAR76### pulled a large clothes brush out of ###CHAR76###'s bag and began sweeping off the soot ###CHAR22### hadn't managed to beat away. 
###CHAR84### took ###CHAR68###'s glasses, gave them a tap of ###CHAR68###'s wand, and returned them, good as new. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Well, gotta be off,'' said ###CHAR22###, who was having ###CHAR68###'s hand wrung by ###CHAR83### -LRB-``Knockturn Alley! 
###DIALOGUE###If you hadn't found ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR22###!''-RRB-
. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``See yer at Hogwarts!'' 
And ###CHAR68### strode away, head and shoulders taller than anyone else in the packed street. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Guess who I saw in Borgin and Burkes?'' 
###CHAR68### asked ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### as they climbed the Gringotts steps. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR50### and ###CHAR50###'s fa ther.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Did ###CHAR50### buy anything?'' 
said ###CHAR84### sharply behind them. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``No, ###CHAR50### was selling =' ``So ###CHAR50###'s worried,'' said ###CHAR84### with grim satisfaction. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Oh, I'd love to get ###CHAR50### for something ...'' ``You be careful, ###CHAR64###,'' said ###CHAR83### sharply as they were bowed into the bank by a goblin at the door. 
###DIALOGUE###``That family's trou ble. 
###DIALOGUE###Don't go biting off more than you can chew -'' ``So you don't think I'm a match for ###CHAR50### ?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR84### indignantly, but ###CHAR84### was distracted almost at once by the sight of ###CHAR25###'s parents, who were standing nervously at the counter that ran all along the great marble hall, waiting for ###CHAR25### to introduce them. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But you're Muggles!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR84### delightedly. 
###DIALOGUE###``We must have a drink! 
What's that you've got there? 
Oh, you're changing Muggle money. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR9###, look!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR84### pointed excitedly at the tenpound notes in Mr. Granger's hand. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Meet you back here,'' ###CHAR68### said to ###CHAR25### as the Weasleys and ###CHAR68### were led off to their underground vaults by another Gringotts goblin. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The vaults were reached by means of small, goblin-driven carts that sped along miniature train tracks through the bank's underground tunnels. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the Weasleys' vault, but felt dreadful, far worse than ###CHAR68### had in Knockturn Alley, when it was opened. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There was a very small pile of silver Sickles inside, and just one gold Galleon. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR83### felt right into the corners before sweeping the whole lot into ###CHAR83###'s bag. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### felt even worse when they reached ###CHAR68###'s vault. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### tried to block the contents from view as ###CHAR68### hastily shoved handfuls of coins into a leather bag. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Back outside on the marble steps, they all separated. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR70### muttered vaguely about needing a new quill. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR55### and ###CHAR19### had spotted their friend from ###CHAR26###, ###CHAR97### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR83### and ###CHAR76### were going to a secondhand robe shop. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR84### was insisting on taking the Grangers off to the Leaky Cauldron for a drink. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We'll all meet at Flourish and Blotts in an hour to buy your schoolbooks,'' said ###CHAR83### , setting off with ###CHAR76###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``And not one step down Knockturn Alley!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR83### shouted at the twins' retreating backs. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###, ###CHAR68###, and ###CHAR25### strolled off along the winding, cobbled street. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The bag of gold, silver, and bronze jangling cheerfully in ###CHAR68###'s pocket was clamoring to be spent, so ###CHAR68### bought three large strawberry-and-peanut-butter ice creams, which they slurped happily as they wandered up the alley, examining the fascinating shop windows. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### gazed longingly at a full set of Chudley Can non robes in the windows of Quality Quidditch Supplies until ###CHAR25### dragged them off to buy ink and parchment next door. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###In Gambol and Japes Wizarding Joke Shop, they met ###CHAR55###, ###CHAR19###, and ###CHAR97### , who were stocking up on Dr. Filibuster's Fabulous Wet-Start, No-Heat Fireworks, and in a tiny junk shop full of broken wands, lopsided brass scales, and old cloaks covered in potion stains they found ###CHAR70###, deeply immersed in a small and deeply boring book called Prefects Who Gained Power. 
###DIALOGUE###`A study of ###CHAR26### prefects and their later careers, '' ###CHAR68### read aloud off the back cover. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``That sounds fascinating ...'' ``Go away,'' ###CHAR70### snapped. ''
###DIALOGUE###`Course, ###CHAR70###'s very ambitious, ###CHAR70###, ###CHAR70###'s got it all planned out ... ###CHAR70### wants to be Minister of Magic... '' ###CHAR68### told ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### in an undertone as they left ###CHAR70### to it. 
An hour later, they headed for Flourish and Blotts. 
They were by no means the only ones making their way to the bookshop. 
As they approached it, they saw to their surprise a large crowd jostling out side the doors, trying to get in. 
###DIALOGUE###The reason for this was proclaimed by a large banner stretched across the upper windows: ###CHAR73### will be signing copies of ###CHAR73###'s autobiography MAGICAL ME today 12:30 P.m. to 4:30 P.m. ``We can actually meet ###CHAR50###!'' 
###CHAR25### squealed. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I mean, ###CHAR50###'s written almost the whole booklist!'' 
The crowd seemed to be made up mostly of witches around ###CHAR83### 's age. 
A harrassed-looking wizard stood at the door, saying, ``Calmly, please, ladies ... Don't push, there ... mind the books, now ... '' ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR68###, and ###CHAR25### squeezed inside. 
A long line wound right to the back of the shop, where ###CHAR73### was signing ###CHAR73###'s books. 
They each grabbed a copy of The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 and sneaked up the line to where the rest of the Weasleys were standing with Mr. and ###CHAR71### . 
###DIALOGUE###``Oh, there you are, good,'' said ###CHAR83### . 
###CHAR83### sounded breathless and kept patting ###CHAR83###'s hair. 
###DIALOGUE###``We'll be able to see ###CHAR50### in a minute ...'' ###CHAR73### came slowly into view, seated at a table surrounded by large pictures of ###CHAR73###'s own face, all winking and flashing dazzlingly white teeth at the crowd. 
The real ###CHAR73### was wearing robes of forget-me-not blue that exactly matched ###CHAR73###'s eyes; ###CHAR73###'s pointed wizard's hat was set at a jaunty angle on ###CHAR73###'s wavy hair. 
A short, irritable-looking man was dancing around taking photographs with a large black camera that emitted puffs of purple smoke with every blinding flash. 
###DIALOGUE###``Out of the way, there,'' he snarled at ###CHAR68###, moving back to get a better shot. 
###DIALOGUE###``This is for the Daily Prophet -'' ``Big deal,'' said ###CHAR68###, rubbing ###CHAR68###'s foot where the photographer had stepped on it. 
###CHAR73### heard ###CHAR73###. 
###CHAR73### looked up. 
###CHAR73### saw ###CHAR68### and then ###CHAR68### saw ###CHAR68###. 
###CHAR68### stared. 
###DIALOGUE###Then ###CHAR68### leapt to ###CHAR68###'s feet and positively shouted, ``It can't be ###CHAR54### ?'' 
The crowd parted, whispering excitedly; ###CHAR73### dived forward, seized ###CHAR68###'s arm, and pulled ###CHAR73### to the front. 
The crowd burst into applause. 
###CHAR68###'s face burned as ###CHAR73### shook ###CHAR73###'s hand for the photographer, who was clicking away madly, wafting thick smoke over the Weasleys. 
###DIALOGUE###``Nice big smile, ###CHAR68###,'' said ###CHAR73###, through ###CHAR73###'s own gleaming teeth. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Together, you and I are worth the front page.'' 
When ###CHAR73### finally let go of ###CHAR68###'s hand, ###CHAR68### could hardly feel ###CHAR68###'s fingers. 
###CHAR68### tried to sidle back over to the Weasleys, but ###CHAR73### threw an arm around ###CHAR73###'s shoulders and clamped ###CHAR73### tightly to ###CHAR73###'s side. 
###DIALOGUE###``Ladies and gentlemen,'' ###CHAR73### said loudly, waving for quiet. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What an extraordinary moment this is! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The perfect moment for me to make a little announcement I've been sitting on for some time! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``When young ###CHAR68### here stepped into Flourish and Blotts today, ###CHAR68### only wanted to buy my autobiography -which I shall be happy to present ###CHAR68### now, free of charge-'' The crowd applauded again. 
###DIALOGUE###``###CHAR68### had no idea,'' ###CHAR73### continued, giving ###CHAR68### a little shake that made ###CHAR73###'s glasses slip to the end of ###CHAR73###'s nose, ``that ###CHAR68### would shortly be getting much, much more than my book, Magical Me. 
###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68###'s schoolmates will, in fact, be getting the real magical me. 
###DIALOGUE###Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I have great pleasure and pride in announcing that this September, I will be taking up the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at ###CHAR26### and Wizardry!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The crowd cheered and clapped and ###CHAR68### found himself being presented with the entire works of ###CHAR73### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Staggering slightly under their weight, ###CHAR73### managed to make ###CHAR73###'s way out of the limelight to the edge of the room, where ###CHAR76### was standing next to ###CHAR76###'s new cauldron. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You have these,'' ###CHAR68### mumbled to ###CHAR76###, tipping the books into the cauldron. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I'll buy my own -'' ``Bet you loved that, didn't you, ###CHAR54###?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said a voice ###CHAR68### had no trouble recognizing. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### straightened up and found himself face-to-face with ###CHAR0### , who was wearing ###CHAR0###'s usual sneer. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Famous ###CHAR54### ,'' said ###CHAR50###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Can't even go into a bookshop without making the front page.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Leave ###CHAR54### alone, ###CHAR54### didn't want all that!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR76###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It was the first time ###CHAR76### had spoken in front of ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR76### was glaring at Malfoy. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR54###, you've got yourself a girlfriend!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###drawled ###CHAR50###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR76### went scarlet as ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### fought their way over, both clutching stacks of ###CHAR73###'s books. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Oh, it's you,'' said ###CHAR68###, looking at Malfoy as if he were something unpleasant on the sole of his shoe. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Bet you're surprised to see ###CHAR68### here, eh?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Not as surprised as I am to see you in a shop, ###CHAR55###,'' retorted ###CHAR50###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay for all those.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### went as red as ###CHAR76###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### dropped ###CHAR68###'s books into the cauldron, too, and started toward ###CHAR50###, but ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### grabbed the back of ###CHAR68###'s jacket. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR68###!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR84### , struggling over with ###CHAR55### and ###CHAR19###. 
###DIALOGUE###``What are you doing? 
###DIALOGUE###It's too crowded in here, let's go outside.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Well, well, well - ###CHAR64### .'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It was ###CHAR50### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR50### stood with ###CHAR50###'s hand on ###CHAR0###'s shoulder, sneering in just the same way. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR50###,'' said ###CHAR84### , nodding coldly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Busy time at the Ministry, I hear,'' said ###CHAR50### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``All those raids ... I hope they're paying you overtime?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR50### reached into ###CHAR76###'s cauldron and extracted, from amid the glossy ###CHAR73### books, a very old, very battered copy of A Beginner's Guide to Transfiguration. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Obviously not,'' ###CHAR50### said. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Dear me, what's the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don't even pay you well for it?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR84### flushed darker than either ###CHAR68### or ###CHAR76###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard, ###CHAR50###,'' ###CHAR50### said. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Clearly,'' said ###CHAR50### , ###CHAR50###'s pale eyes straying to Mr. and ###CHAR71### , who were watching apprehensively. 
###DIALOGUE###``The company you keep, ###CHAR55### ... and I thought your family could sink no lower =' There was a thud of metal as ###CHAR76###'s cauldron went flying; ###CHAR84### had thrown himself at ###CHAR50### , knocking ###CHAR50### backward into a bookshelf. 
###DIALOGUE###Dozens of heavy spellbooks came thundering down on all their heads; there was a yell of, ``Get ###CHAR50###, Dad!'' 
###DIALOGUE###from ###CHAR55### or ###CHAR19###; ###CHAR83### was shrieking, ``No, ###CHAR64###, no!''
###DIALOGUE###; the crowd stampeded backward, knocking more shelves over; ``Gentlemen, please - please!'' 
cried the assistant, and then, louder than all ``Break it up, there, gents, break it up -'' ###CHAR22### was wading toward them through the sea of books. 
In an instant he had pulled ###CHAR84### and ###CHAR50### apart. 
###CHAR84### had a cut lip and ###CHAR50### had been hit in the eye by an Encyclopedia of Toadstools. 
###CHAR50### was still holding ###CHAR76###'s old Transfiguration book. 
###CHAR50### thrust it at ###CHAR76###, ###CHAR50###'s eyes glittering with malice. 
###DIALOGUE###``Here, girl - take your book - it's the best your father can give you -'' Pulling himself out of ###CHAR22###'s grip ###CHAR50### beckoned to Draco and swept from the shop. 
###DIALOGUE###``Yeh should've ignored him, ###CHAR64###,'' said ###CHAR22###, almost lifting ###CHAR84### off ###CHAR84###'s feet as ###CHAR84### straightened ###CHAR84###'s robes. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Rotten ter the core, the whole family, everyone knows that - no ###CHAR50###'s worth listenin' ter - bad blood, that's what it is - come on now - let's get outta here.'' 
The assistant looked as though ###CHAR84### wanted to stop them leaving, but ###CHAR84### barely came up to ###CHAR22###'s waist and seemed to think better of it. 
They hurried up the street, the Grangers shaking with fright and ###CHAR83### beside herself with fury. 
###DIALOGUE###``A fine example to set for your children ... brawling in public ... what ###CHAR73### must've thought -'' ``###CHAR73### was pleased,'' said ###CHAR55###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Didn't you hear ###CHAR73### as we were leaving? 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR73### was asking that bloke from the Daily Prophet if ###CHAR73###'d be able to work the fight into ###CHAR73###'s report - said it was all publicity -'' But it was a subdued group that headed back to the fireside in the Leaky Cauldron, where ###CHAR68###, the Weasleys, and all their shopping would be traveling back to the Burrow using Floo powder. 
They said good-bye to the Grangers, who were leaving the pub for the Muggle street on the other side; ###CHAR84### started to ask them how bus stops worked, but stopped quickly at the look on ###CHAR83### 's face. 
###CHAR68### took off ###CHAR68###'s glasses and put them safely in ###CHAR68###'s pocket before helping himself to Floo powder. 
It definitely wasn't ###CHAR68###'s favorite way to travel.
THE WHOMPING WILLOW
The end of the summer vacation came too quickly for ###CHAR68###'s liking. 
###CHAR68### was looking forward to getting back to Hogwarts, but ###CHAR68###'s month at the Burrow had been the happiest of ###CHAR68###'s life. 
It was difficult not to feel jealous of ###CHAR68### when ###CHAR68### thought of the ###CHAR88### and the sort of welcome ###CHAR68### could expect next time ###CHAR68### turned up on Privet Drive. 
On their last evening, ###CHAR83### conjured up a sumptuous dinner that included all of ###CHAR68###'s favorite things, ending with a mouthwatering treacle pudding. 
###CHAR55### and ###CHAR19### rounded off the evening with a display of Filibuster fireworks; they fiIled the kitchen with red and blue stars that bounced from ceiling to wall for at least half an hour. 
Then it was time for a last mug of hot chocolate and bed. 
It took a long while to get started next morning. 
They were up at dawn, but somehow they still seemed to have a great deal to do. 
###CHAR83### dashed about in a bad mood looking for spare socks and quills; people kept colliding on the stairs, half-dressed with bits of toast in their hands; and ###CHAR84### nearly broke ###CHAR84###'s neck, tripping over a stray chicken as ###CHAR84### crossed the yard carrying ###CHAR76###'s trunk to the car. 
Harry couldn't see how eight people, six large trunks, two owls, and a rat were going to fit into one small ###CHAR60### . 
He had reckoned, of course, without the special features that ###CHAR84### had added. 
###DIALOGUE###``Not a word to ###CHAR9###,'' ###CHAR84### whispered to ###CHAR68### as ###CHAR68### opened the. 
trunk and showed ###CHAR68### how it had been magically expanded so that the luggage fitted easily. 
###DIALOGUE###When at last they were all in the car, ###CHAR83### glanced into the back seat, where ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR55###, ###CHAR19###, and ###CHAR70### were all sitting comfortably side by side, and said, ``Muggles do know more than we give them credit for, don't they?'' 
###CHAR83### and ###CHAR76### got into the front seat, which had been stretched so that it resembled a park bench. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I mean, you'd never know it was this roomy from the outside, would you?'' 
###CHAR84### started up the engine and they trundled out of the yard, ###CHAR68### turning back for a last look at the house. 
###CHAR68### barely had time to wonder when ###CHAR68###'d see it again when they were back ###CHAR19### had forgotten ###CHAR19###'s box of Filibuster fireworks. 
Five minutes after that, they skidded to a halt in the yard so that ###CHAR55### could run in for ###CHAR55###'s broomstick. 
They had almost reached the highway when ###CHAR76### shrieked that ###CHAR76###'d left ###CHAR76###'s diary. 
By the time ###CHAR76### had clambered back into the car, they were running very late, and tempers were running high. 
###CHAR84### glanced at ###CHAR84###'s watch and then at ###CHAR84###'s wife. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Molly, dear -'' ``No, ###CHAR64### -'' ``No one would see - this little button here is an Invisibility Booster I installed - that'd get us up in the air - then we fly above the clouds. 
###DIALOGUE###We'd be there in ten minutes and no one would be any the wiser -'' ``I said no, ###CHAR64###, not in broad daylight -'' They reached King's Cross at a quarter to eleven. 
###CHAR84### dashed across the road to get trolleys for their trunks and they all hurried into the station. 
###CHAR68### had caught the ###CHAR62### the previous year. 
The tricky part was getting onto platform nine and three-quarters, which wasn't visible to the Muggle eye. 
What you had to do was walk through the solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten. 
It didn't hurt, but it had to be done carefully so that none of the Muggles noticed you vanishing. 
###DIALOGUE###``Percy first,'' said ###CHAR83### , looking nervously at the clock overhead, which showed they had only five minutes to disappear casually through the barrier. 
###CHAR70### strode briskly forward and vanished. 
###CHAR84### went next; ###CHAR55### and ###CHAR19### followed. 
###DIALOGUE###``I'll take ###CHAR76### and you two come right after us,'' ###CHAR83### told ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68###, grabbing ###CHAR76###'s hand and setting off. 
In the blink of an eye they were gone. 
###DIALOGUE###``Let's go together, we've only got a minute,'' ###CHAR68### said to ###CHAR68###. 
###CHAR68### made sure that ###CHAR33###'s cage was safely wedged on top of ###CHAR68###'s trunk and wheeled ###CHAR68###'s trolley around to face the barrier. 
###CHAR68### felt perfectly confident; this wasn't nearly as uncomfortable as using Floo powder. 
Both of them bent low over the handles of their trolleys and walked purposefully toward the barrier, gathering speed. 
A few feet away from it, they broke into a run and CRASH. 
###DIALOGUE###Both trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward; ###CHAR68###'s trunk fell off with a loud thump, ###CHAR68### was knocked off ###CHAR68###'s feet, and ###CHAR33###'s cage bounced onto the shiny floor, and ###CHAR33### rolled away, shrieking indignantly; people all around them stared and a guard nearby yelled, ``What in blazes d'you think you're doing?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Lost control of the trolley,'' ###CHAR68### gasped, clutching ###CHAR68###'s ribs as ###CHAR68### got up. 
###CHAR68### ran to pick up ###CHAR33###, who was causing such a scene that there was a lot of muttering about cruelty to animals from the surrounding crowd. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Why can't we get through?'' 
###CHAR68### hissed to ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``I dunno -'' ###CHAR68### looked wildly around. 
A dozen curious people were still watching them. 
###DIALOGUE###``We're going to miss the train,'' ###CHAR68### whispered. 
###DIALOGUE###``I don't understand why the gateway's sealed itself -'' ###CHAR68### looked up at the giant clock with a sickening feeling in the pit of ###CHAR68###'s stomach. 
Ten seconds ... nine seconds ... ###CHAR68### wheeled ###CHAR68###'s trolley forward cautiously until it was right against the barrier and pushed with all ###CHAR68###'s might. 
The metal remained solid. 
Three seconds ... two seconds ... one second ... ``It's gone,'' said ###CHAR68###, sounding stunned. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``The train's left. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###What if Mum and Dad can't get back through to us? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Have you got any Muggle money?'' 
And they marched off through the crowd of curious Muggles, out of the station and back onto the side road where the old ###CHAR60### was parked. 
###CHAR68### unlocked the cavernous trunk with a series of taps from ###CHAR68###'s wand. 
They heaved their luggage back in, put Hedwig on the back seat, and got into the front. 
###DIALOGUE###``Check that no one's watching,'' said ###CHAR68###, starting the ignition with another tap of ###CHAR68###'s wand. 
###CHAR68### stuck ###CHAR68###'s head out of the window: Traffic was rumbling along the main road ahead, but their street was empty. 
###DIALOGUE###``Okay,'' ###CHAR68### said. 
###CHAR68### pressed a tiny silver button on the dashboard. 
The car around them vanished - and so did they. 
###CHAR68### could feel the seat vibrating beneath ###CHAR68###, hear the engine, feel ###CHAR68###'s hands on ###CHAR68###'s knees and ###CHAR68###'s glasses on ###CHAR68###'s nose, but for all ###CHAR68### could see, ###CHAR68### had become a pair of eyeballs, floating a few feet above the ground in a dingy street full of parked cars. 
###DIALOGUE###``Let's go,'' said ###CHAR68###'s voice from ###CHAR68###'s right. 
And the ground and the dirty buildings on either side fell away, dropping out of sight as the car rose; in seconds, the whole of London lay, smoky and glittering, below them. 
Then there was a popping noise and the car, ###CHAR68###, and ###CHAR68### reappeared. 
###DIALOGUE###``Uh-oh,'' said ###CHAR68###, jabbing at the Invisibility Booster. 
###DIALOGUE###``It's faulty -'' Both of them pummeled it. 
The car vanished. 
Then it flickered back again. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Hold on!'' 
###CHAR68### yelled, and ###CHAR68### slammed ###CHAR68###'s foot on the accelerator; they shot straight into the low, woolly clouds and everything turned dull and foggy. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Now what?'' 
said ###CHAR68###, blinking at the solid mass of cloud pressing in on them from all sides. 
###DIALOGUE###``We need to see the train to know what direction to go in,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``Dip back down again - quickly -'' They dropped back beneath the clouds and twisted around in their seats, squinting at the ground. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I can see it!'' 
###CHAR68### yelled. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Right ahead - there!'' 
The ###CHAR62### was streaking along below them like a scarlet snake. 
###DIALOGUE###``Due north,'' said ###CHAR68###, checking the compass on the dashboard. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Okay, we'll just have to check on it every half hour or so - hold on And they shot up through the clouds. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###A minute later, they burst out into a blaze of sunlight. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It was a different world. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The wheels of the car skimmed the sea of fluffy cloud, the sky a bright, endless blue under the blinding white sun. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``All we've got to worry about now are airplanes,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They looked at each other and started to laugh; for a long time, they couldn't stop. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It was as though they had been plunged into a fabulous dream. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###This, thought ###CHAR68###, was surely the only way to travel - past swirls and turrets of snowy cloud, in a car full of hot, bright sunlight, with a fat pack of toffees in the glove compartment, and the prospect of seeing ###CHAR55###'s and ###CHAR19###'s jealous faces when they landed smoothly and spectacularly on the sweeping lawn in front of Hogwarts castle. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They made regular checks on the train as they flew farther and farther north, each dip beneath the clouds showing them a different view. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###London was soon far behind them, replaced by neat green fields that gave way in turn to wide, purplish moors, a great city alive with cars like multicolored ants, villages with tiny toy churches. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Several uneventful hours later, however, ###CHAR68### had to admit that some of the fun was wearing off. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The toffees had made them extremely thirsty and they had nothing to drink. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### had pulled off their sweaters, but ###CHAR68###'s T-shirt was sticking to the back of ###CHAR68###'s seat and ###CHAR68###'s glasses kept sliding down to the end of ###CHAR68###'s sweaty nose. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### had stopped noticing the fantastic cloud shapes now and was thinking longingly of the train miles below, where you could buy ice-cold pumpkin juice from a trolley pushed by a plump witch. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Why hadn't they been able to get onto platform nine and three-quarters? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Can't be much further, can it?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###croaked ###CHAR68###, hours later still, as the sun started to sink into their floor of cloud, staining it a deep pink. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Ready for another check on the train?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It was still right below them, winding its way past a snowcapped mountain. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It was much darker beneath the canopy of clouds. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### put ###CHAR68###'s foot on the accelerator and drove them upward again, but as ###CHAR68### did so, the engine began to whine. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### exchanged nervous glances. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It's probably just tired,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It's never been this far before ...'' And they both pretended not to notice the whining growing louder and louder as the sky became steadily darker. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Stars were blossoming in the blackness. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### pulled ###CHAR68###'s sweater back on, try ing to ignore the way the windshield wipers were now waving fee bly, as though in protest. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Not far,'' said ###CHAR68###, more to the car than to ###CHAR68###, ``not far now,'' and ###CHAR68### patted the dashboard nervously. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###When they flew back beneath the clouds a little while later, they had to squint through the darkness for a landmark they knew. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``There!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### shouted, making ###CHAR68### and Hedwig jump. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Straight ahead!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Silhouetted on the dark horizon, high on the cliff over the lake, stood the many turrets and towers of Hogwarts castle. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###But the car had begun to shudder and was losing speed. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Come on,'' ###CHAR68### said cajolingly, giving the steering wheel a lit tle shake, ``nearly there, come on -'' The engine groaned. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Narrow jets of steam were issuing from un der the hood. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### found himself gripping the edges of ###CHAR68###'s seat very hard as they flew toward the lake. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The car gave a nasty wobble. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Glancing out of ###CHAR68###'s window, ###CHAR68### saw the smooth, black, glassy surface of the water, a mile below. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###'s knuckles were white on the steering wheel. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The car wobbled again. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Come on,'' ###CHAR68### muttered. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They were over the lake - the castle was right ahead - ###CHAR68### put ###CHAR68###'s foot down. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There was a loud clunk, a splutter, and the engine died com pletely. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Uh-oh,'' said ###CHAR68###, into the silence. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The nose of the car dropped. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They were falling, gathering speed, heading straight for the solid castle wall. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Noooooo!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### yelled, swinging the steering wheel around; they missed the dark stone wall by inches as the car turned in a great arc, soaring over the dark greenhouses, then the vegetable patch, and then out over the black lawns, losing altitude all the time. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR68### let go of the steering wheel completely and pulled ###CHAR68###'s wand out of ###CHAR68###'s back pocket ``STOP! 
###DIALOGUE###STOP!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### yelled, whacking the dashboard and the windshield, but they were still plummeting, the ground flying up toward them ``WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREE!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### bellowed, lunging for the steering wheel, but too late CRUNCH. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###With an earsplitting bang of metal on wood, they hit the thick tree trunk and dropped to the ground with a heavy jolt. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Steam was billowing from under the crumpled hood; Hedwig was shrieking in terror; a golfball-size lump was throbbing on ###CHAR68###'s head where ###CHAR68### had hit the windshield; and to ###CHAR68###'s right, ###CHAR68### let out a low, despairing groan. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Are you okay?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### said urgently. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``My wand,'' said ###CHAR68###, in a shaky voice. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Look at my wand -'' It had snapped, almost in two; the tip was dangling limply, held on by a few splinters. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### opened ###CHAR68###'s mouth to say ###CHAR68### was sure they'd be able to mend it up at the school, but ###CHAR68### never even got started. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###At that very moment, something hit ###CHAR68###'s side of the car with the force of a charging bull, sending ###CHAR68### lurching sideways into ###CHAR68###, just as an equally heavy blow hit the roof. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What's happen -?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### gasped, staring through the windshield, and ###CHAR68### looked around just in time to see a branch as thick as a python smash into it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The tree they had hit was attacking them. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Its trunk was bent almost double, and its gnarled boughs were pummeling every inch of the car it could reach. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Aaargh!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68### as another twisted limb punched a large dent into ###CHAR68###'s door; the windshield was now trembling under a hail of blows from knuckle-like twigs and a branch as thick as a battering ram was pounding furiously on the roof, which seemed to be caving ``Run for it!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### shouted, throwing ###CHAR68###'s full weight against ###CHAR68###'s door, but next second ###CHAR68### had been knocked backward into ###CHAR68###'s lap by a vicious uppercut from another branch. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We're done for!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### moaned as the ceiling sagged, but suddenly the floor of the car was vibrating - the engine had restarted. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Reverse!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### yelled, and the car shot backward; the tree was still trying to hit them; they could hear its roots creaking as it almost ripped itself up, lashing out at them as they sped out of reach. 
###DIALOGUE###``That,'' panted ###CHAR68###, ``was close. 
###DIALOGUE###Well done, car -'' The car, however, had reached the end of its tether. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###With two sharp clunks, the doors flew open and ###CHAR68### felt ###CHAR68###'s seat tip sideways: Next thing ###CHAR68### knew ###CHAR68### was sprawled on the damp ground. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Loud thuds told ###CHAR68### that the car was ejecting their luggage from the trunk; Hedwig's cage flew through the air and burst open; she rose out of it with an angry screech and sped off toward the castle without a backward look. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Then, dented, scratched, and steaming, the car rumbled off into the darkness, its rear lights blazing angrily. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Come back!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### yelled after it, brandishing ###CHAR68###'s broken wand. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Dad'll kill me!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###But the car disappeared from view with one last snort from its exhaust. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Can you believe our luck?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68### miserably, bending down to pick up Scabbers. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Of all the trees we could've hit, we had to get one that hits back.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### glanced over ###CHAR68###'s shoulder at the ancient tree, which was still flailing its branches threateningly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Come on,'' said ###CHAR68### wearily, ``we'd better get up to the school ...'' It wasn't at all the triumphant arrival they had pictured. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Stiff, cold, and bruised, they seized the ends of their trunks and began dragging them up the grassy slope, toward the great oak front doors. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I think the feast's already started,'' said ###CHAR68###, dropping ###CHAR68###'s trunk at the foot of the front steps and crossing quietly to look through a brightly lit window. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Hey - ###CHAR68### - come and look - it's the Sorting!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### hurried over and, together, ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### peered in at the Great Hall. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Innumerable candles were hovering in midair over four long, crowded tables, making the golden plates and goblets sparkle. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Overhead, the bewitched ceiling, which always mirrored the sky outside, sparkled with stars. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Through the forest of pointed black Hogwarts hats, ###CHAR68### saw a long line of scared-looking first years fiIing into the Hall. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR76### was among them, easily visible because of ###CHAR76###'s vivid ###CHAR55### ha-ir. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Meanwhile, Professor ###CHAR96###, a bespectacled witch with ###CHAR76###'s hair in a tight bun, was placing the famous Hogwarts Sorting Hat on a stool before the newcomers. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Every year, this aged old hat, patched, frayed, and dirty, sorted new students into the four Hogwarts houses -LRB-Gryffindor, ###CHAR80###, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin-RRB-. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### well remembered putting it on, exactly one year ago, and waiting, petrified, for its decision as it muttered aloud in ###CHAR68###'s ear. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###For a few horrible seconds ###CHAR68### had feared that the hat was going to put ###CHAR68### in Slytherin, the house that had turned out more Dark witches and wizards than any other -but ###CHAR68### had ended up in Gryffindor, along with ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR25###, and the rest of the Weasleys. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Last term, ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### had helped Gryffindor win the House Championship, beating Slytherin for the first time in seven years. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###A very small, mousy-haired boy had been called forward to place the hat on his head. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###'s eyes wandered past ###CHAR68### to where Professor ###CHAR94###, the headmaster, sat watching the Sorting from the staff table, ###CHAR94###'s long silver beard and half-moon glasses shining brightly in the candlelight. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Several seats along, ###CHAR68### saw ###CHAR73### , dressed in robes of aquamarine. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###And there at the end was ###CHAR22###, huge and hairy, drinking deeply from ###CHAR68###'s goblet. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Hang on... '' ###CHAR68### muttered to ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``There's an empty chair at the staff table ... Where's ###CHAR63###?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Professor ###CHAR63### was ###CHAR68###'s least favorite teacher. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### also happened to be ###CHAR63###'s least favorite student. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Cruel, sarcastic, and disliked by everybody except the students from ###CHAR68###'s own house -LRB-Slytherin-RRB-, ###CHAR63### taught Potions. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Maybe ###CHAR63###'s ill!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68### hopefully. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Maybe ###CHAR63###'s left,'' said Ha-rry, ``because ###CHAR63### missed out on the Defense Against Dark Arts job again!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Or ###CHAR63### might have been sacked!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68### enthusiastically. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I mean, everyone hates ###CHAR63### -'' ``Or maybe,'' said a very cold voice right behind them, ``###CHAR63###'s waiting to hear why you two didn't arrive on the school train.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### spun around. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There, ###CHAR68###'s black robes rippling in a cold breeze, stood ###CHAR63### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR63### was a thin man with sallow skin, a hooked nose, and greasy, shoulder-length black hair, and at this moment, ###CHAR63### was smiling in a way that told ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### were in very deep trouble. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Follow me,'' said ###CHAR63###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Not daring even to look at each other, ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### followed ###CHAR63### up the steps into the vast, echoing entrance hall, which was lit with flaming torches. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###A delicious smell of food was wafting from the Great Hall, but ###CHAR63### led them away from the warmth and light, down a narrow stone staircase that led into the dungeons. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``In!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR63### said, opening a door halfway down the cold passageway and pointing. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They entered ###CHAR63###'s office, shivering. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The shadowy walls were lined with shelves of large glass-RRB- ars, in which floated all manner of revolting things ###CHAR68### didn't really want to know the name of at the moment. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The fireplace was dark and empty. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR63### closed the door and turned to look at them. 
###DIALOGUE###``So,'' ###CHAR63### said softly, ``the train isn't good enough for the famous ###CHAR54### and ###CHAR54###'s faithful sidekick ###CHAR55###. 
###DIALOGUE###Wanted to arrive with a bang, did we, boys?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``No, sir, it was the barrier at King's Cross, it -'' ``Silence!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR63### coldly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What have you done with the car?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### gulped. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###This wasn't the first time ###CHAR63### had given Harry the impression of being able to read minds. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###But a moment later, ###CHAR63### un derstood, as ###CHAR63### unrolled today's issue of the Evening Prophet. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You were seen,'' ###CHAR63### hissed, showing them the headline: FLY ING FORD ANGLIA MYSTIFIES MUGGLES. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR63### began to read aloud: ``Two Muggles in London, convinced they saw an old car flying over the Post Office tower ... at noon in Norfolk, Mrs. Hetty Bayliss, while hanging out her washing ... Mr. Angus Fleet, of Peebles, reported to police ... Six or seven Muggles in all. 
###DIALOGUE###I be lieve your father works in the ###CHAR17### ?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR63### said, looking up at ###CHAR68### and smiling still more nastily. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Dear, dear ... his own son... '' ###CHAR68### felt as though ###CHAR68###'d just been walloped in the stomach by one of the mad tree's larger branches. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###If anyone found out ###CHAR84### had bewitched the car ... ###CHAR84### hadn't thought of that ... ``I noticed, in my search of the park, that considerable damage seems to have been done to a very valuable Whomping Willow,'' ###CHAR63### went on. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``That tree did more damage to us than we -'' ###CHAR68### blurted out. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Silence!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###snapped ###CHAR63### again. 
###DIALOGUE###``Most unfortunately, you are not in my ###CHAR42### and the decision to expel you does not rest with me. 
I shall go and fetch the people who do have that happy power. 
###DIALOGUE###You will wait here.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### stared at each other, white-faced. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### didn't feel hungry any more. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### now felt extremely sick. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### tried not to look at a large, slimy something suspended in green liquid on a shelf behind ###CHAR63###'s desk. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###If ###CHAR63### had gone to fetch Professor ###CHAR96###, head of ###CHAR42### , they were hardly any better off. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###She might be fairer than ###CHAR63###, but she was still extremely strict. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Ten minutes later, ###CHAR63### returned, and sure enough it was Professor ###CHAR96### who accompanied ###CHAR63###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### had seen Professor ###CHAR96### angry on several occasions, but either ###CHAR68### had forgotten just how thin her mouth could go, or ###CHAR68### had never seen her this angry before. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###She raised her wand the moment she entered; ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### both flinched, but she merely pointed it at the empty fireplace, where flames suddenly erupted. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Sit,'' she said, and they both backed into chairs by the fire. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Explain,'' she said, her glasses glinting ominously. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### launched into the story, starting with the barrier at the station refusing to let them through. '' 
###DIALOGUE###-so we had no choice, Professor, we couldn't get on the train.'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Why didn't you send us a letter by owl? 
###DIALOGUE###I believe you have an owl?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Professor ###CHAR96### said coldly to ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### gaped at her. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Now she said it, that seemed the obvious thing to have done. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I - I didn't think -'' ``That,'' said Professor ###CHAR96###, ``is obvious.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There was a knock on the office door and ###CHAR63###, now looking happier than ever, opened it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There stood the headmaster, Professor ###CHAR94###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###'s whole body went numb. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR94### was looking unusually grave. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR94### stared down ###CHAR94###'s very crooked nose at them, and ###CHAR68### suddenly found himself wishing ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### were still being beaten up by the Whomping Willow. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There was a long silence. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Then ###CHAR94### said, ``Please explain why you did this.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It would have been better if ###CHAR94### had shouted. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### hated the disappointment in ###CHAR68###'s voice. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###For some reason, ###CHAR68### was unable to look ###CHAR94### in the eyes, and spoke instead to ###CHAR94###'s knees. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR94### told ###CHAR94### everything except that ###CHAR84### owned the bewitched car, making it sound as though ###CHAR84### and ###CHAR68### had happened to find a flying car parked outside the station. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### knew ###CHAR94### would see through this at once, but ###CHAR94### asked no questions about the car. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###When ###CHAR68### had finished, ###CHAR68### merely continued to peer at them through ###CHAR68###'s spectacles. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We'll go and get our stuff,'' said ###CHAR68### in a hopeless sort of voice. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What are you talking about, ###CHAR55###?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###barked Professor ###CHAR96###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Well, you're expelling us, aren't you?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### looked quickly at ###CHAR94###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Not today, ###CHAR84### ,'' said ###CHAR94###. 
###DIALOGUE###``But I must impress upon both of you the seriousness of what you have done. 
I will be writing to both your families tonight. 
###DIALOGUE###I must also warn you that if you do anything like this again, I will have no choice but to expel you.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR63### looked as though Christmas had been canceled. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR94### cleared ###CHAR94###'s throat and said, ``Professor ###CHAR94###, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry, caused serious damage to an old and valuable tree - surely acts of this nature -'' ``It will be for Professor ###CHAR96### to decide on these boys' punishments, ###CHAR63###,'' said ###CHAR94### calmly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``They are in ###CHAR94###'s House and are therefore ###CHAR94###'s responsibility.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR94### turned to Professor ###CHAR96###. 
###DIALOGUE###``I must go back to the feast, Minerva, I've got to give out a few notices. 
###DIALOGUE###Come, ###CHAR63###, there's a delicious-looking cus tard tart I want to sample -'' ###CHAR63### shot a look of pure venom at ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### as ###CHAR68### allowed himself to be swept out of ###CHAR68###'s office, leaving them alone with Pro fessor McGonagall, who was still eyeing them like a wrathful eagle. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You'd better get along to the hospital wing, ###CHAR55###, you're bleeding.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Not much,'' said ###CHAR68###, hastily wiping the cut over ###CHAR68###'s eye with ###CHAR68###'s sleeve. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Professor, I wanted to watch my sister being Sorted -'' ``The Sorting Ceremony is over,'' said Professor ###CHAR96###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Your sister is also in Gryffindor.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Oh, good,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``And speaking of Gryffindor -'' Professor ###CHAR96### said sharply, but ###CHAR68### cut in: ``Professor, when we took the car, term hadn't started, so - so Gryffindor shouldn't really have points taken from it - should it?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### finished, watching ###CHAR68###'s anxiously. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Professor ###CHAR96### gave him a piercing look, but he was sure ###CHAR68### had almost smiled. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###'s mouth looked less thin, anyway. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I will not take any points from Gryffindor,'' ###CHAR68### said, and ###CHAR68###'s heart lightened considerably. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But you will both get a de tention.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It was better than ###CHAR68### had expected. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###As for ###CHAR94###'s writing to the ###CHAR88###, that was nothing. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### knew perfectly well they'd just be disappointed that the Whomping Willow hadn't squashed ###CHAR68### flat. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Professor ###CHAR96### raised ###CHAR68###'s wand again and pointed it at ###CHAR63###'s desk. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###A large plate of sandwiches, two silver goblets, and a jug of-iced pumpkin juice appeared with a pop. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You will eat in here and then go straight up to your dormitory,'' ###CHAR68### said. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I must also return to the feast.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###When the door had closed behind ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR68### let out a long, low whistle. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I thought we'd had it,'' ###CHAR68### said, grabbing a sandwich. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``So did I,'' said ###CHAR68###, taking one, too. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Can you believe our luck, though?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68### thickly through a mouthful of chicken and ham. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Fred and ###CHAR19### must've flown that car five or six times and no Muggle ever saw them.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### swallowed and took another huge bite. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Why couldn't we get through the barrier?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### shrugged. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We'll have to watch our step from now on, though,'' ###CHAR68### said, taking a grateful swig of pumpkin juice. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Wish we could've gone up to the feast ...'' ``She didn't want us showing off,'' said ###CHAR68### sagely. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Doesn't want people to think it's clever, arriving by flying car.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###When they had eaten as many sandwiches as they could -LRB-the plate kept refilling itself-RRB- they rose and left the office, treading the familiar path to Gryffindor Tower. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The castle was quiet; it seemed that the feast was over. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They walked past muttering portraits and creaking suits of armor, and climbed narrow flights of stone stairs, until at last they reached the passage where the secret entrance to Gryffindor Tower was hidden, behind an oil painting of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Password?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###she said as they approached. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Er -'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They didn't know the new year's password, not having met a Gryffindor prefect yet, but help came almost immediately; they heard hurrying feet behind them and turned to see ###CHAR25### dashing toward them. 
###DIALOGUE###``There you are! 
Where have you been? 
###DIALOGUE###The most ridiculous rumors - someone said you'd been expelled for crashing a flying car ``Well, we haven't been expelled,'' ###CHAR68### assured ###CHAR25###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You're not telling me you did fly here?'' 
said ###CHAR25###, sounding almost as severe as Professor ###CHAR96###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Skip the lecture,'' said ###CHAR68### impatiently, ``and tell us the new password.'' 
###DIALOGUE###``It's `wattlebird,''' said ###CHAR25### impatiently, ``but that's not the point - '' ###CHAR25###'s words were cut short, however, as the portrait of the fat lady swung open and there was a sudden storm of clapping. 
It looked as though the whole of ###CHAR42### was still awake, packed into the circular common room, standing on the lopsided tables and squashy armchairs, waiting for them to arrive. 
Arms reached through the portrait hole to pull ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### inside, leaving ###CHAR25### to scramble in after then-t. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Brilliant!'' 
yelled ###CHAR97### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Inspired! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###What an entrance! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Flying a car right into the Whomping Willow, people'll be talking about that one for years -'' ``Good for you,'' said a fifth year ###CHAR68### had never spoken to; someone was patting ###CHAR68### on the back as though ###CHAR68###'d just won a marathon; ###CHAR55### and ###CHAR19### pushed their way to the front of the crowd and said together, ``Why couldn't we've come in the car, eh?'' 
###CHAR68### was scarlet in the face, grinning embarrassedly, but ###CHAR68### could see one person who didn't look happy at all. 
###CHAR70### was visible over the heads of some excited first years, and ###CHAR70### seemed to be trying to get near enough to start telling them off. 
###CHAR68### nudged ###CHAR68### in the ribs and nodded in ###CHAR70###'s direction. 
###CHAR68### got the point at once. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Got to get upstairs - bit tired,'' ###CHAR68### said, and the two of them started pushing their way toward the door on the other side of the room, which led to a spiral staircase and the dormitories. ''
###DIALOGUE###`Night,'' ###CHAR68### called back to ###CHAR25###, who was wearing a scowl just like ###CHAR70###'s. 
They managed to get to the other side of the common room, still having their backs slapped, and gained the peace of the staircase. 
They hurried up it, right to the top, and at last reached the door of their old dormitory, which now had a sign on it saying SECOND YEARS. 
They entered the familiar, circular room, with its five four-posters hung with red velvet and its high, narrow windows. 
Their trunks had been brought up for them and stood at the ends of their beds. 
###CHAR68### grinned guiltily at Harry. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I know I shouldn't've enjoyed that or anything, but =' The dormitory door flew open and in came the other second year Gryffindor boys, ###CHAR4### , ###CHAR28### , and ###CHAR92### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Unbelievable!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###beamed ###CHAR4###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Cool,'' said ###CHAR28###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Amazing,'' said ###CHAR92###, awestruck. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### couldn't help it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### grinned, too.
###DIALOGUE###
###CHAR73### The next day, however, ###CHAR68### barely grinned once. 
Things started to go downhill from breakfast in the Great Hall. 
The four long house tables were laden with tureens of porridge, plates of kippers, mountains of toast, and dishes of eggs and bacon, beneath the enchanted ceiling -LRB-today, a dull, cloudy gray-RRB-. 
###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### sat down at the Gryffindor table next to ###CHAR25###, who had ###CHAR25###'s copy of Voyages with Vampires propped open against a milk jug. 
There was a slight stiffness in the way ###CHAR25### said ``Morning,'' which told ###CHAR68### that ###CHAR25### was still disapproving of the way they had arrived. 
###CHAR92### , on the other hand, greeted them cheerfully. 
###CHAR92### was a round-faced and accident-prone boy with the worst memory of anyone ###CHAR68### had ever met. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Mail's due any minute - I think Gran's sending a few things I forgot.'' 
###CHAR68### had only just started ###CHAR68###'s porridge when, sure enough, there was a rushing sound overhead and a hundred or so owls streamed in, circling the hall and dropping letters and packages into the chattering crowd. 
A big, lumpy package bounced off ###CHAR92###'s head and, a second later, something large and gray fell into ###CHAR25###'s jug, spraying them all with milk and feathers. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Enrol!'' 
said ###CHAR68###, pulling the bedraggled owl out by the feet. 
###CHAR74### slumped, unconscious, onto the table, ###CHAR74###'s legs in the air and a damp red envelope in ###CHAR74###'s beak. 
###DIALOGUE###``Oh, no -'' ###CHAR68### gasped. 
###DIALOGUE###``It's all right, ###CHAR92###'s still alive,'' said ###CHAR25###, prodding ###CHAR74### gently with the tip of ###CHAR25###'s finger. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It's not that - it's that.'' 
###CHAR68### was pointing at the red envelope. 
It looked quite ordinary to ###CHAR68###, but ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR92### were both looking at it as though they expected it to explode. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What's the matter?'' 
said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``She's - she's sent me a Howler,'' said ###CHAR68### faintly. 
###DIALOGUE###``You'd better open it, ###CHAR68###,'' said ###CHAR92### in a timid whisper. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It'll be worse if you don't My gran sent me one once, and I ignored it and'' - ###CHAR92### gulped - ``it was horrible.'' 
###CHAR68### looked from their petrified faces to the red envelope. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What's a Howler?'' 
###CHAR68### said. 
But ###CHAR68###'s whole attention was fixed on the letter, which had begun to smoke at the corners. 
###DIALOGUE###``Open it,'' ###CHAR92### urged. 
###DIALOGUE###``It'll all be over in a few minutes -'' ###CHAR68### stretched out a shaking hand, eased the envelope from ###CHAR74###'s beak, and slit it open. 
###CHAR92### stuffed ###CHAR92###'s fingers in ###CHAR92###'s ears. 
A split second later, ###CHAR68### knew why. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR68### thought for a moment it had exploded; a roar of sound fiIled the huge hall, shaking dust from the ceiling. ''
###DIALOGUE###- STEALING THE CAR, I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SURPRISED IF THEY'D EXPELLED YOU, YOU WAIT TILL I GET HOLD OF YOU, I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU STOPPED TO THINK WHAT YOUR FATHER AND I WENT THROUGH WHEN WE SAW IT WAS GONE -'' ###CHAR51### yells, a hundred times louder than usual, made the plates and spoons rattle on the table, and echoed deafeningly off the stone walls. 
###DIALOGUE###People throughout the hall were swiveling around to see who had received the Howler, and ###CHAR68### sank so low in ###CHAR68###'s chair that only ###CHAR68###'s crimson forehead could be seen. ''
###DIALOGUE###- LETTER FROM ###CHAR94### LAST NIGHT, I THOUGHT YOUR FATHER WOULD DIE OF SHAME, WE DIDN'T BRING YOU UP TO BEHAVE LIKE THIS, YOU AND HARRY COULD BOTH HAVE DIED -'' ###CHAR68### had been wondering when ###CHAR68###'s name was going to crop up. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR68### tried very hard to look as though ###CHAR68### couldn't hear the voice that was making ###CHAR68###'s eardrums throb. ''
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###-ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED - YOUR FATHER'S FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK, IT'S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT AND IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE WE'LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT BACK HOME.'' 
A ringing silence fell. 
The red envelope, which had dropped from ###CHAR68###'s hand, burst into flames and curled into ashes. 
###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### sat stunned, as though a tidal wave had just passed over them. 
A few people laughed and, gradually, a babble of talk broke out again. 
###CHAR25### closed Voyages with Vampires and looked down at the top of ###CHAR68###'s head. 
###DIALOGUE###``Well, I don't know what you expected, ###CHAR68###, but you -'' ``Don't tell me I deserved it,'' snapped ###CHAR68###. 
###CHAR68### pushed ###CHAR68###'s porridge away. 
###CHAR68###'s insides were burning with guilt. 
###CHAR84### was facing an inquiry at work. 
After all Mr. and ###CHAR83### had done for ###CHAR84### over the summer ... But ###CHAR84### had no time to dwell on this; Professor ###CHAR96### was moving along the Gryffindor table, handing out course schedules. 
###CHAR68### took ###CHAR68###'s and saw that they had double Herbology with the Hufepuffs first. 
###CHAR68###, ###CHAR68###, and ###CHAR25### left the castle together, crossed the vegetable patch, and made for the greenhouses, where the magical plants were kept. 
At least the Howler had done one good thing: ###CHAR25### seemed to think they had now been punished enough and was being perfectly friendly again. 
As they neared the greenhouses they saw the rest of the class standing outside, waiting for Professor Sprout. 
###CHAR68###, ###CHAR68###, and ###CHAR25### had only just joined them when ###CHAR25### came striding into view across the lawn, accompanied by ###CHAR73### . 
Professor Sprout's arms were full of bandages, and with another twinge of guilt, ###CHAR68### spotted the Whomping Willow in the distance, several of its branches now in slings. 
Professor Sprout was a squat little witch who wore a patched hat over her flyaway hair; there was usually a large amount of earth on her clothes and her fingernails would have made Aunt Petunia faint. 
###CHAR73### , however, was immaculate in sweeping robes of turquoise, ###CHAR73###'s golden hair shining under a perfectly positioned turquoise hat with gold trimming. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Oh, hello there!'' 
###CHAR73### called, beaming around at the assembled students. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Just been showing Professor Sprout the right way to doctor a Whomping Willow! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###But I don't want you running away with the idea that I'm better at Herbology than she is! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I just happen to have met several of these exotic plants on my travels ...'' ``Greenhouse three today, chaps!'' 
said Professor Sprout, who was looking distinctly disgruntled, not at all her usual cheerful self. 
There was a murmur of interest. 
They had only ever worked in greenhouse one before - greenhouse three housed far more interesting and dangerous plants. 
Professor ###CHAR91### took a large key from her belt and unlocked the door. 
###CHAR68### caught a whiff of damp earth and fertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume of some giant, umbrellasized flowers dangling from the ceiling. 
###CHAR68### was about to follow ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### inside when ###CHAR73###'s hand shot out. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Harry! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I've been wanting a word - you don't mind if he's a couple of minutes late, do you, Professor Sprout?'' 
Judging by Professor Sprout's scowl, ###CHAR25### did mind, but ###CHAR73### said, ``That's the ticket,'' and closed the greenhouse door in ###CHAR25###'s face. 
###DIALOGUE###``Harry,'' said ###CHAR73###, ###CHAR73###'s large white teeth gleaming in the sunlight as ###CHAR73### shook ###CHAR73###'s head. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Harry, ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR68###.'' 
Completely nonplussed, ###CHAR68### said nothing. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``When I heard -well, of course, it was all my fault. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Could have kicked myself.'' 
###CHAR68### had no idea what ###CHAR68### was talking about. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR68### was about to say so when ###CHAR73### went on, ``Don't know when I've been more shocked. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Flying a car to Hogwarts! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Well, of course, I knew at once why you'd done it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Stood out a mile. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###, ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR68###.'' 
It was remarkable how ###CHAR73### could show every one of those brilliant teeth even when ###CHAR73### wasn't talking. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Gave you a taste for publicity, didn't I?'' 
said ###CHAR73###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Gave you the bug. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###You got onto the front page of the paper with me and you couldn't wait to do it again.'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Oh, no, Professor, see -'' ``Harry, ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR68###,'' said ###CHAR73###, reaching out and grasping ###CHAR73###'s shoulder. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I understand. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Natural to want a bit more once you've had that first taste - and I blame myself for giving you that, be cause it was bound to go to your head - but see here, young man, you can't start flying cars to try and get yourself noticed. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Just calm down, all right? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Plenty of time for all that when you're older. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Yes, yes, I know what you're thinking! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###`It's all right for him, he's an in ternationally famous wizard already!' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###But when I was twelve, I was just as much of a nobody as you are now. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###In fact, Id say I was even more of a nobody! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I mean, a few people have heard of you, haven't they? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###All that business with He-\``o-Must-Not-Be-Named!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR73### glanced at the lightning scar on ###CHAR68###'s forehead. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I know, I know - it's not quite as good as winning Witch Weekly's Most Charming-Smile Award five times in a row, as I have - but it's a start, ###CHAR68###, it's a start.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### gave ###CHAR68### a hearty wink and strode off. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### stood stunned for a few seconds, then, remembering ###CHAR68### was supposed to be in the greenhouse, ###CHAR68### opened the door and slid inside. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Professor Sprout was standing behind a trestle bench in the cen ter of the greenhouse. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###About twenty pairs of different-colored ear muffs were lying on the bench. 
###DIALOGUE###When ###CHAR68### had taken ###CHAR68###'s place between ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25###, ###CHAR25### said, ``We'll be repotting Man drakes today. 
###DIALOGUE###Now, who can tell me the properties of the Man drake?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###To nobody's surprise, ###CHAR25###'s hand was first into the air. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Mandrake, or Mandragora, is a powerful restorative,'' said ###CHAR25###, sounding as usual as though ###CHAR25### had swallowed the textbook. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It is used to return people who have been transfigured or cursed to their original state.'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Excellent. 
###DIALOGUE###Ten points to Gryffindor,'' said Professor Sprout. 
###DIALOGUE###``The Mandrake forms an essential part of most antidotes. 
It is also, however, dangerous. 
###DIALOGUE###Who can tell me why?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR25###'s hand narrowly missed ###CHAR68###'s glasses as it shot up again. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``The cry of the Mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears it,'' ###CHAR25### said promptly. 
###DIALOGUE###``Precisely. 
###DIALOGUE###Take another ten points,'' said Professor Sprout. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Now, the Mandrakes we have here are still very young.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR25### pointed to a row of deep trays as ###CHAR25### spoke, and everyone shuffled forward for a better look. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###A hundred or so tufty little plants, purplish green in color, were growing there in rows. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They looked quite unremarkable to ###CHAR68###, who didn't have the slightest idea what ###CHAR25### meant by the ``cry'' of the Mandrake. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Everyone take a pair of earmuffs,'' said Professor Sprout. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There was a scramble as everyone tried to seize a pair that wasn't pink and fluffy. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``When I tell you to put them on, make sure your ears are completely covered,'' said Professor Sprout. 
###DIALOGUE###``When it is safe to remove them, I will give you the thumbs-up. 
###DIALOGUE###Right - earmuffs on.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### snapped the earmuffs over ###CHAR68###'s ears. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They shut out sound completely. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Professor Sprout put the pink, fluffy pair over ###CHAR25###'s own ears, rolled up the sleeves of ###CHAR25###'s robes, grasped one of the tufty plants firmly, and pulled hard. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### let out a gasp of surprise that no one could hear. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Instead of roots, a small, muddy, and extremely ugly baby popped out of the earth. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The leaves were growing right out of ###CHAR68###'s head. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### had pale green, mottled skin, and was clearly bawling at the top of ###CHAR68###'s lungs. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Professor ###CHAR91### took a large plant pot from under the table and plunged the Mandrake into it, burying him in dark, damp compost until only the tufted leaves were visible. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Professor Sprout dusted off ###CHAR68###'s hands, gave them all the thumbs-up, and removed ###CHAR68###'s own earmuffs. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``As our Mandrakes are only seedlings, their cries won't kill yet,'' ###CHAR68### said calmly as though ###CHAR68###'d just done nothing more exciting than water a begonia. 
###DIALOGUE###``However, they will knock you out for several hours, and as I'm sure none of you want to miss your first day back, make sure your earmuffs are securely in place while you work. 
I will attract your attention when it is time to pack up. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Four to a tray - there is a large supply of pots here - compost in the sacks over there - and be careful of the Venemous Tentacula, it's teething.'' 
###CHAR68### gave a sharp slap to a spiky, dark red plant as ###CHAR68### spoke, making it draw in the long feelers that had been inching sneakily over ###CHAR68###'s shoulder. 
###CHAR68###, ###CHAR68###, and ###CHAR25### were joined at their tray by a curly-haired ###CHAR80### boy ###CHAR68### knew by sight but had never spoken to. 
###DIALOGUE###``###CHAR100### ,'' ###CHAR68### said brightly, shaking ###CHAR68### by the hand. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Know who you are, of course, the famous ###CHAR54### ... And you're ###CHAR25### - always top in everything'' -LRB-###CHAR25### beamed as ###CHAR25### had ###CHAR25###'s hand shaken too-RRB- ''- and ###CHAR46### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Wasn't that your flying car?'' 
###CHAR68### didn't smile. 
The Howler was obviously still on ###CHAR68###'s mind. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``That ###CHAR73###'s something, isn't ###CHAR73###?'' 
said ###CHAR100### happily as they began fiIling their plant pots with dragon dung compost. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Awfully brave chap. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Have you read ###CHAR73###'s books? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Id have died of fear if Id been cornered in a telephone booth by a werewolf, but ###CHAR73### stayed cool and - zap - just fantastic. 
###DIALOGUE###``My name was down for ###CHAR90###, you know. 
I can't tell you how glad I am I came here instead. 
###DIALOGUE###Of course, Mother was slightly disappointed, but since I made her read ###CHAR73###'s books I think she's begun to see how useful it'll be to have a fully trained wizard in the family ...'' After that they didn't have much chance to talk. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Their earmuffs were back on and they needed to concentrate on the Mandrakes. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Professor Sprout had made it look extremely easy, but it wasn't. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The Mandrakes didn't like coming out of the earth, but didn't seem to want to go back into it either. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They squirmed, kicked, flailed their sharp little fists, and gnashed their teeth; ###CHAR68### spent ten whole minutes trying to squash a particularly fat one into a pot. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###By the end of the class, ###CHAR68###, like everyone else, was sweaty, aching, and covered in earth. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Everyone traipsed back to the castle for a quick wash and then the Gryffindors hurried off to Transfiguration. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Professor ###CHAR96###'s classes were always hard work, but today was especially difficult. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Everything ###CHAR68### had learned last year seemed to have leaked out of ###CHAR68###'s head during the summer. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### was supposed to be turning a beetle into a button, but all ###CHAR68### managed to do was give ###CHAR68###'s beetle a lot of exercise as it scuttled over the desktop avoiding ###CHAR68###'s wand. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### was having far worse problems. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### had patched up ###CHAR68###'s wand with some borrowed Spellotape, but it seemed to be damaged beyond repair. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It kept crackling and sparking at odd moments, and every time ###CHAR68### tried to transfigure ###CHAR68###'s beetle it engulfed ###CHAR68### in thick gray smoke that smelled of rotten eggs. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Unable to see what ###CHAR68### was doing, ###CHAR68### accidentally squashed ###CHAR68###'s beetle with ###CHAR68###'s elbow and had to ask for a new one. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Professor ###CHAR96### wasn't pleased. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### was relieved to hear the lunch bell. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###'s brain felt like a wrung sponge. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Everyone fiIed out of the classroom except ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68###, who was whacking ###CHAR68###'s wand furiously on the desk. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Stupid - useless - thing -'' ``Write home for another one,'' ###CHAR68### suggested as the wand let off a volley of bangs like a firecracker. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Oh, yeah, and get another Howler back,'' said ###CHAR68###, stuffing the now hissing wand into ###CHAR68###'s bag. '' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###`It's your own fault your wand got snapped - ''' They went down to lunch, where ###CHAR68###'s mood was not improved by ###CHAR25###'s showing them the handful of perfect coat buttons ###CHAR25### had produced in Transfiguration. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What've we got this afternoon?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68###, hastily changing the subject. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Defense Against the Dark Arts,'' said ###CHAR25### at once. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Why, ``demanded ###CHAR68###, seizing her schedule, ``have you outlined all ###CHAR73###'s lessons in little hearts?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR25### snatched the schedule back, blushing furiously. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They finished lunch and went outside into the overcast courtyard. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR25### sat down on a stone step and buried ###CHAR25###'s nose in Voyages with Vampires again. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### stood talking about Quidditch for several minutes before ###CHAR68### became aware that ###CHAR68### was being closely watched. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Looking up, ###CHAR68### saw the very small, mousy-haired boy ###CHAR68###'d seen trying on the Sorting Hat last night staring at ###CHAR68### as though transfixed. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### was clutching what looked like an ordinary Muggle camera, and the moment ###CHAR68### looked at ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR68### went bright red. 
###DIALOGUE###``All right, ###CHAR68###? 
###DIALOGUE###I'm -I'm ###CHAR66### ,'' ###CHAR68### said breathlessly, taking a tentative step forward. 
###DIALOGUE###``I'm in Gryffindor, too. 
###DIALOGUE###D'you think - would it be all right if - can I have a picture?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### said, raising the camera hopefully. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``A picture?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Harry repeated blankly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``So I can prove I've met you,'' said ###CHAR66### eagerly, edging further forward. 
###DIALOGUE###``I know all about you. 
Everyone's told me. 
###DIALOGUE###About how you survived when You-Know-Who tried to kill you and how ###CHAR68### disappeared and everything and how you've still got a lightning scar on your forehead'' -LRB-his eyes raked ###CHAR68###'s hairline-RRB- ``and a boy in my dormitory said if I develop the film in the right potion, the pictures'll move.'' 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR66### drew a great shuddering breath of excitement and said, ``It's amazing here, isn't it? 
I never knew all the odd stuff I could do was magic till I got the letter from Hogwarts. 
My dad's a milkman, he couldn't believe it either. 
So I'm taking loads of pictures to send home to him. 
And it'd be really good if I had one of you'' - ###CHAR66### looked imploringly at ###CHAR68### - ``maybe your friend could take it and I could stand next to you? 
###DIALOGUE###And then, could you sign it?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Signed photos? 
###DIALOGUE###You're giving out signed photos, ###CHAR54###?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Loud and scathing, ###CHAR0### 's voice echoed around the courtyard. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### had stopped right behind ###CHAR66###, flanked, as ###CHAR66### always was at Hogwarts, by ###CHAR66###'s large and thuggish cronies, ###CHAR44### and Goyle. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Everyone line up!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR50### roared to the crowd. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR54### 's giving out signed photos!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``No, I'm not,'' said ###CHAR68### angrily, ###CHAR68###'s fists clenching. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Shut up, ###CHAR50###.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You're just jealous,'' piped up ###CHAR66###, whose entire body was about as thick as ###CHAR44###'s neck. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###`jealous?
###DIALOGUE###``said ###CHAR50###, who didn't need to shout anymore: half the courtyard was listening in. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Of what? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I don't want a foul scar right across my head, thanks. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I don't think getting your head cut open makes you that special, myself.'' 
###CHAR44### and Goyle were sniggering stupidly. 
###DIALOGUE###``Eat slugs, ###CHAR50###,'' said ###CHAR68### angrily. 
###CHAR44### stopped laughing and started rubbing ###CHAR44###'s knuckles in a menacing way. 
###DIALOGUE###``Be careful, ###CHAR55###,'' sneered Malfoy. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You don't want to start any trouble or your Mommy'll have to come and take you away from school.'' 
He put on a shrill, piercing voice. 
###DIALOGUE###``Ifyou put another toe out of line' - '' A knot of Slytherin fifth-years nearby laughed loudly at this. 
###DIALOGUE###``###CHAR55### would like a signed photo, ###CHAR54###,'' smirked ###CHAR50###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It'd be worth more than ###CHAR54###'s family's whole house -'' ###CHAR68### whipped out ###CHAR50###'s Spellotaped wand, but ###CHAR25### shut Voyages with Vampires with a snap and whispered, ``Look out!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What's all this, what's all this?'' 
###CHAR73### was striding toward them, ###CHAR73###'s turquoise robes swirling behind ###CHAR73###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Who's giv ing out signed photos?'' 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR68### started to speak but ###CHAR68### was cut short as ###CHAR73### flung an arm around ###CHAR68###'s shoulders and thundered jovially, ``Shouldn't have asked! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###We meet again, ###CHAR68###!'' 
Pinned to ###CHAR73###'s side and burning with humiliation, Harry saw Malfoy slide smirking back into the crowd. 
###DIALOGUE###``Come on then, Mr. Creevey,'' said ###CHAR73###, beaming at Colin. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``A double portrait, can't do better than that, and we'll both sign it for you.'' 
Colin fumbled for his camera and took the picture as the bell rang behind them, signaling the start of afternoon classes. 
###DIALOGUE###``Off you go, move along there,'' ###CHAR73### called to the crowd, and ###CHAR73### set off back to the castle with ###CHAR68###, who was wishing ###CHAR68### knew a good Vanishing Spell, still clasped to ###CHAR68###'s side. 
###DIALOGUE###``A word to the wise, ###CHAR68###,'' said ###CHAR73### paternally as they entered the building through a side door. 
###DIALOGUE###``I covered up for you back there with young ###CHAR66### - if ###CHAR66### was photographing me, too, your schoolmates won't think you're setting yourself up so much ...'' Deaf to ###CHAR68###'s stammers, ###CHAR73### swept ###CHAR73### down a corridor lined with staring students and up a staircase. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Let me just say that handing out signed pictures at this stage of your career isn't sensible - looks a tad bigheaded, ###CHAR68###, to be frank. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There may well come a time when, like me, you'll need to keep a stack handy wherever you go, but'' - ###CHAR73### gave a little chor tle - ``I don't think you're quite there yet.'' 
They had reached ###CHAR73###'s classroom and ###CHAR73### let ###CHAR68### go at last. 
###CHAR68### yanked ###CHAR68###'s robes straight and headed for a seat at the very back of the class, where ###CHAR68### busied himself with piling all seven of ###CHAR73###'s books in front of ###CHAR73###, so that ###CHAR73### could avoid looking at the real thing. 
The rest of the class came clattering in, and ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### sat down on either side of ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``You could've fried an egg on your face'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You'd better hope ###CHAR66### doesn't meet ###CHAR76###, or they'll be starting a ###CHAR54### fan club.'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Shut up,'' snapped ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###The last thing ###CHAR68### needed was for ###CHAR73### to hear the phrase ``###CHAR54### fan club.'' 
When the whole class was seated, ###CHAR73### cleared ###CHAR73###'s throat loudly and silence fell. 
###CHAR73### reached forward, picked up ###CHAR92### 's copy of Travels with Trolls, and held it up to show ###CHAR73###'s own, winking portrait on the front. 
###DIALOGUE###``Me,'' ###CHAR73### said, pointing at it and winking as well. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR73### , Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the ###CHAR57### , and five-time winner of Witch Weekly's Most- Charming-Smile Award - but I don't talk about that. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at her!'' 
###CHAR73### waited for them to laugh; a few people smiled weakly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I see you've all bought a complete set of my books -well done. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I thought we'd start today with a little quiz. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Nothing to worry about just to check how well you've read them, how much you've taken in -'' When ###CHAR73### had handed out the test papers ###CHAR73### returned to the front of the class and said, ``You have thirty minutes - start - now!'' 
###CHAR68### looked down at ###CHAR68###'s paper and read:
1. 
What is ###CHAR73### 's favorite color? 
2. 
What is ###CHAR73### 's secret ambition? 
3. 
What, in your opinion, is ###CHAR73### 's greatest achievement to date?
On and on it went, over three sides of paper, right down to:
54. 
When is ###CHAR73### 's birthday, and what would 
###CHAR73###'s ideal gift be? 
Half an hour later, ###CHAR73### collected the papers and rifled through them in front of the class. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Tut, tut - hardly any of you remembered that my favorite color is lilac. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I say so in Year with the Yeti. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###And a few of you need to read Wanderings with Werewolves more carefully - I clearly state in chapter twelve that my ideal birthday gift would be harmony between all magic and non-magic peoples - though I wouldn't say no to a large bottle of Ogdeds Old Firewhisky!'' 
###CHAR73### gave them another roguish wink. 
###CHAR68### was now staring at ###CHAR73### with an expression of disbelief on ###CHAR73###'s face; ###CHAR4### and ###CHAR28### , who were sitting in front, were shaking with silent laughter. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR25###, on the other hand, was listening to ###CHAR73### with rapt attention and gave a start when ###CHAR73### mentioned ###CHAR25###'s name. ''
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###... but ###CHAR25### knew my secret ambition is to rid the world of evil and market my own range of hair-care potions - good girl! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###In fact'' - ###CHAR73### flipped her paper over - ``full marks! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Where is ###CHAR25### ?'' 
###CHAR25### raised a trembling hand. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Excellent!'' 
beamed ###CHAR73###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Quite excellent! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Take ten points for Gryffindor! 
###DIALOGUE###And so - to business -'' ###CHAR73### bent down behind ###CHAR73###'s desk and lifted a large, covered cage onto it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Now - be warned! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###You may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###All I ask is that you remain calm.'' 
In spite of himself, ###CHAR68### leaned around ###CHAR68###'s pile of books for a better look at the cage. 
###CHAR73### placed a hand on the cover. 
###CHAR28### and ###CHAR4### had stopped laughing now. 
###CHAR92### was cowering in ###CHAR92###'s front row seat. 
###DIALOGUE###``I must ask you not to scream,'' said ###CHAR73### in a low voice. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It might provoke them.'' 
As the whole class held its breath, ###CHAR73### whipped off the cover. 
###DIALOGUE###``Yes,'' ###CHAR73### said dramatically. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Freshly caught Cornish pixies. '' 
###CHAR4### couldn't control himself. 
###CHAR73### let out a snort of laughter that even ###CHAR73### couldn't mistake for a scream of terror. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Yes?'' 
###CHAR73### smiled at ###CHAR4###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Well, they're not - they're not very - dangerous, are they?'' 
###CHAR4### choked. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Don't be so sure!'' 
said ###CHAR73###, waggling a finger annoyingly at ###CHAR4###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Devilish tricky little blighters they can be!'' 
The pixies were electric blue and about eight inches high, with pointed faces and voices so shrill it was like listening to a lot of budgies arguing. 
The moment the cover had been removed, they had started jabbering and rocketing around, rattling the bars and making bizarre faces at the people nearest them. 
###DIALOGUE###``Right, then,'' ###CHAR73### said loudly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Let's see what you make of them!'' 
And ###CHAR73### opened the cage. 
It was pandemonium. 
The pixies shot in every direction like rockets. 
Two of them seized ###CHAR92### by the ears and lifted ###CHAR92### into the air. 
Several shot straight through the window, showering the back row with broken glass. 
The rest proceeded to wreck the classroom more effectively than a rampaging rhino. 
They grabbed ink bottles and sprayed the class with them, shredded books and papers, tore pictures from the walls, up-ended the waste basket, grabbed bags and books and threw them out of the smashed window; within minutes, half the class was sheltering under desks and ###CHAR92### was swinging from the iron chandelier in the ceiling. 
###DIALOGUE###``Come on now - round them up, round them up, they're only pixies,'' ###CHAR73### shouted. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR73### rolled up ###CHAR73###'s sleeves, brandished ###CHAR73###'s wand, and bellowed, ``Peskipiksi Pesternomi!'' 
It had absolutely no effect; one of the pixies seized ###CHAR73###'s wand and threw it out of the window, too. 
###CHAR73### gulped and dived under ###CHAR73###'s own desk, narrowly avoiding being squashed by ###CHAR92###, who fell a second later as the chandelier gave way. 
The bell rang and there was a mad rush toward the exit. 
###DIALOGUE###In the relative calm that followed, ###CHAR73### straightened up, caught sight of ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR68###, and ###CHAR25###, who were almost at the door, and said, ``Well, I'll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage.'' 
###CHAR73### swept past them and shut the door quickly behind ###CHAR73###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Can you believe him?'' 
roared ###CHAR68### as one of the remaining pixies bit ###CHAR68### painfully on the ear. 
###DIALOGUE###``He just wants to give us some hands-on experience,'' said ###CHAR25###, immobilizing two pixies at once with a clever Freezing Charm and stuffing them back into their cage. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Hands on? 
###DIALOGUE###``said ###CHAR68###, who was trying to grab a pixie dancing out of reach with its tongue out. 
###DIALOGUE###``###CHAR25###, ###CHAR68### didn't have a clue what ###CHAR68### was doing -'' ``Rubbish,'' said ###CHAR25###. 
###DIALOGUE###``You've read ###CHAR68###'s books - look at all those amazing things ###CHAR68###'s done -'' ``###CHAR68### says ###CHAR68###'s done,'' ###CHAR68### muttered. 
arry spent a lot of time over the next few days dodging out of sight whenever ###CHAR68### saw ###CHAR73### coming down a corridor. 
Harder to avoid was ###CHAR66### , who seemed to have memorized ###CHAR68###'s schedule. 
###DIALOGUE###Nothing seemed to give ###CHAR66### a bigger thrill than to say, ``All right, ###CHAR68###?'' 
six or seven times a day and hear, ``Hello, ###CHAR66###,'' back, however exasperated ###CHAR68### sounded when ###CHAR68### said it. 
###CHAR33### was still angry with ###CHAR68### about the disasterous car journey and ###CHAR68###'s wand was still malfunctioning, surpassing itself on Friday morning by shooting out of ###CHAR68###'s hand in Charms and hitting tiny old Professor ###CHAR2### squarely between the eyes, creating a large, throbbing green boil where it had struck. 
So with one thing and another, ###CHAR68### was quite glad to reach the weekend. 
###CHAR68###, ###CHAR68###, and ###CHAR25### were planning to visit ###CHAR22### on Saturday morning. 
###CHAR68###, however, was shaken awake several hours earlier than ###CHAR68### would have liked by ###CHAR43### , Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Whassamatter?'' 
said ###CHAR68### groggily. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Quidditch practice!'' 
said ###CHAR43###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Come on!'' 
###CHAR68### squinted at the window. 
There was a thin mist hanging across the pink-and-gold sky. 
Now that ###CHAR68### was awake, ###CHAR68### couldn't understand how ###CHAR68### could have slept through the racket the birds were making. 
###DIALOGUE###``###CHAR43###,'' ###CHAR68### croaked. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It's the crack of dawn.'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Exactly,'' said ###CHAR43###. 
###CHAR68### was a tall and burly sixth year and, at the moment, ###CHAR68###'s eyes were gleaming with a crazed enthusiasm. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It's part of our new training program. 
###DIALOGUE###Come on, grab your broom, and let's go,'' said ###CHAR43### heartily. 
###DIALOGUE###``None of the other teams have started training yet; we're going to be first off the mark this year -'' Yawning and shivering slightly, ###CHAR68### climbed out of bed and tried to find ###CHAR68###'s Quidditch robes. 
###DIALOGUE###``Good man,'' said ###CHAR43###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Meet you on the field in fifteen minutes. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###When he'd found his scarlet team robes and pulled on his cloak for warmth, ###CHAR68### scribbled a note to ###CHAR68### explaining where ###CHAR68###'d gone and went down the spiral staircase to the common room, ###CHAR68###'s Nimbus Two Thousand on ###CHAR68###'s shoulder. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### had just reached the portrait hole when there was a clatter behind ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR66### came dashing down the spiral staircase, ###CHAR66###'s camera swinging madly around ###CHAR66###'s neck and something clutched in ###CHAR66###'s hand. 
###DIALOGUE###``I heard someone saying your name on the stairs, ###CHAR68###! 
Look what I've got here! 
###DIALOGUE###I've had it developed, I wanted to show you -'' ###CHAR68### looked bemusedly at the photograph ###CHAR66### was brandishing under ###CHAR68###'s nose. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###A moving, black-and-white ###CHAR73### was tugging hard on an arm ###CHAR68### recognized as ###CHAR68###'s own. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### was pleased to see that ###CHAR68###'s photographic self was putting up a good fight and refusing to be dragged into view. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###As ###CHAR68### watched, ###CHAR73### gave up and slumped, panting, against the white edge of the picture. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Will you sign it?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR66### eagerly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``No,'' said ###CHAR68### flatly, glancing around to check that the room was really deserted. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Sorry, Colin, I'm in a hurry - Quidditch practice -'' ###CHAR68### climbed through the portrait hole. 
###DIALOGUE###``Oh, wow! 
Wait for me! 
###DIALOGUE###I've never watched a Quidditch game before!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR66### scrambled through the hole after ###CHAR66###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It'll be really boring,'' ###CHAR68### said quickly, but ###CHAR66### ignored ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR68###'s face shining with excitement. 
###DIALOGUE###``You were the youngest ###CHAR42### player in a hundred years, weren't you, ###CHAR68###? 
###DIALOGUE###Weren't you?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR66###, trotting alongside ###CHAR66###. 
###DIALOGUE###``You must be brilliant. 
I've never flown. 
Is it easy? 
Is that your own broom? 
###DIALOGUE###Is that the best one there is?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### didn't know how to get rid of ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It was like having an extremely talkative shadow. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I don't really understand Quidditch,'' said ###CHAR66### breathlessly. 
###DIALOGUE###``Is it true there are four balls? 
###DIALOGUE###And two of them fly around trying to knock people off their brooms?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Yes,'' said ###CHAR68### heavily, resigned to explaining the complicated rules of Quidditch. 
###DIALOGUE###``They're called Bludgers. 
There are two Beaters -RRB-,on each team who carry clubs to beat the Bludgers away from their side. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR55### and ###CHAR19### are the Gryffindor Beaters.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``And what are the other balls for?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Colin asked, tripping down a couple of steps because he was gazing open-mouthed at ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``Well, the Quafe - that's the biggish red one - is the one that scores goals. 
###DIALOGUE###Three Chasers on each team throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through the goal posts at the end of the pitch - they're three long poles with hoops on the end.'' 
###DIALOGUE###``And the fourth ball -'' ''- is the Golden Snitch,'' said ###CHAR68###, ``and it's very small, very fast, and difficult to catch. 
But that's what the Seeker's got to do, because a game of Quidditch doesn't end until the Snitch has been caught. 
###DIALOGUE###And whichever team's Seeker gets the Snitch earns his team an extra hundred and fifty points.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``And you're the Gryffindor Seeker, aren't you?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR66### in awe. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Yes,'' said ###CHAR68### as they left the castle and started across the dewdrenched grass. 
###DIALOGUE###``And there's the Keeper, too. 
He guards the goal posts. 
###DIALOGUE###That's it, really.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###But ###CHAR66### didn't stop questioning ###CHAR68### all the way down the sloping lawns to the Quidditch field, and ###CHAR68### only shook ###CHAR68### off when ###CHAR68### reached the changing rooms; ###CHAR66### called after ###CHAR66### in a piping voice, ``I'll go and get a good seat, ###CHAR68###!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###and hurried off to the stands. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The rest of the Gryffindor team were already in the changing room. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR43### was the only person who looked truly awake. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR55### and ###CHAR19### were sitting, puffy-eyed and touslehaired, next to fourth year ###CHAR3### , who seemed to be nodding off against the wall behind ###CHAR3###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR3###'s fellow Chasers, Katie Bell and Angelina Johnson, were yawning side by side opposite them. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``There you are, ###CHAR68###, what kept you?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR43### briskly. 
###DIALOGUE###``Now, I wanted a quick talk with you all before we actually get onto the field, because I spent the summer devising a whole new training program, which I really think will make all the difference ... ###CHAR43### was holding up a large diagram of a Quidditch field, on which were drawn many lines, arrows, and crosses in differentcolored inks. 
###CHAR43### took out ###CHAR43###'s wand, tapped the board, and the arrows began to wiggle over the diagram like caterpillars. 
As Wood launched into a speech about his new tactics, ###CHAR55### 's head drooped right onto ###CHAR3### 's shoulder and ###CHAR55### began to snore. 
The first board took nearly twenty minutes to explain, but there was another board under that, and a third under that one. 
###CHAR68### sank into a stupor as ###CHAR43### droned on and on. 
###DIALOGUE###``So,'' said ###CHAR43###, at long last, jerking ###CHAR68### from a wistful fantasy about what ###CHAR68### could be eating for breakfast at this very moment up at the castle. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Is that clear? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Any questions?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``I've got a question, ###CHAR43###,'' said ###CHAR19###, who had woken with a start. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Why couldn't you have told us all this yesterday when we were awake?'' 
###CHAR43### wasn't pleased. 
###DIALOGUE###``Now, listen here, you lot,'' ###CHAR43### said, glowering at them all. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We should have won the Quidditch cup last year. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###We're easily the best team. 
###DIALOGUE###But unfortunately -owing to circumstances beyond our control - '' Harry shifted guiltily in his seat. 
He had been unconscious in the hospital wing for the final match of the previous year, meaning that Gryffindor had been a player short and had suffered their worst defeat in three hundred years. 
###CHAR43### took a moment to regain control of himself. 
Their last defeat was clearly still torturing ###CHAR43###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``So this year, we train harder than ever before ... Okay, let's go and put our new theories into practice!'' 
###CHAR43### shouted, seizing ###CHAR43###'s broomstick and leading the way out of the locker rooms. 
Stifflegged and still yawning, ###CHAR43###'s team followed. 
They had been in the locker room so long that the sun was up completely now, although remnants of mist hung over the grass in the stadium. 
As ###CHAR68### walked onto the field, ###CHAR68### saw ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### sitting in the stands. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Aren't you finished yet?'' 
called ###CHAR68### incredulously. 
###DIALOGUE###``Haven't even started,'' said ###CHAR68###, looking jealously at the toast and marmalade ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### had brought out of the Great Hall. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Wood's been teaching us new moves.'' 
He mounted his broomstick and kicked at the ground, soaring up into the air. 
The cool morning air whipped his face, waking him far more effectively than ###CHAR43###'s long talk. 
It felt wonderful to be back on the Quidditch field. 
###CHAR43### soared right around the stadium at full speed, racing ###CHAR55### and ###CHAR19###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What's that funny clicking noise?'' 
called ###CHAR55### as they hurtled around the corner. 
###CHAR68### looked into the stands. 
###CHAR66### was sitting in one of the highest seats, ###CHAR68###'s camera raised, taking picture after picture, the sound strangely magnified in the deserted stadium. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Look this way, ###CHAR68###! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###This way!'' 
###CHAR68### cried shrilly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Who's that?'' 
said ###CHAR55###. 
###DIALOGUE###``No idea,'' ###CHAR68### lied, putting on a spurt of speed that took ###CHAR68### as far away as possible from Colin. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What's going on?'' 
said ###CHAR43###, frowning, as ###CHAR43### skimmed through the air toward them. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Why's that first year taking pictures? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I don't like it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### could be a Slytherin spy, trying to find out about our new training program.'' 
###DIALOGUE###``###CHAR68###'s in Gryffindor,'' said ###CHAR68### quickly. 
###DIALOGUE###``And the Slytherins don't need a spy, ###CHAR43###,'' said ###CHAR19###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What makes you say that?'' 
said ###CHAR43### testily. 
###DIALOGUE###``Because they're here in person,'' said ###CHAR19###, pointing. 
Several people in green robes were walking onto the field, broomsticks in their hands. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I don't believe it!'' 
###CHAR43### hissed in outrage. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I booked the field for today! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###We'll see about this!'' 
###CHAR43### shot toward the ground, landing rather harder than ###CHAR43### meant to in ###CHAR43###'s anger, staggering slightly as ###CHAR43### dismounted. 
###CHAR68###, ###CHAR55###, and ###CHAR19### followed. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Flint!'' 
Wood bellowed at the Slytherin Captain. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``This is our practice time! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###We got up specially! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###You can clear off now!'' 
Marcus Flint was even larger than Wood. 
###DIALOGUE###He had a look of trollish cunning on his face as he replied, ``Plenty of room for all of us, ###CHAR43###.'' 
Angelina, ###CHAR3###, and Katie had come over, too. 
There were no girls on the Slytherin team, who stood shoulder to shoulder, facing the Gryffindors, leering to a man. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But I booked the field!'' 
said ###CHAR43###, positively spitting with rage. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I booked it!'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Ah,'' said Flint. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But I've got a specially signed note here from Professor ###CHAR63###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###`I, Professor S. Snape, give the Slytherin team permission to practice today on the Quidditch field owing to the need to train their new Seeker.''' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You've got a new Seeker?'' 
said ###CHAR43###, distracted. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Where?'' 
And from behind the six large figures before them came a seventh, smaller boy, smirking all over ###CHAR43###'s pale, pointed face. 
It was ###CHAR0### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Aren't you ###CHAR50### 's son?'' 
said ###CHAR55###, looking at Malfoy with dislike. 
###DIALOGUE###``Funny you should mention ###CHAR0###'s father,'' said Flint as the whole Slytherin team smiled still more broadly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Let me show you the generous gift ###CHAR0###'s made to the Slytherin team.'' 
All seven of them held out their broomsticks. 
Seven highly polished, brand-new handles and seven sets of fine gold lettering spelling the words Nimbus Two Thousand and One gleamed under the Gryffindors' noses in the early morning sun. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Very latest model. 
###DIALOGUE###Only came out last month,'' said Flint carelessly, flicking a speck of dust from the end of his own. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I believe it outstrips the old Two Thousand series by a considerable amount. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###As for the old Cleansweeps'' - he smiled nastily at ###CHAR55### and ###CHAR19###, who were both clutching ###CHAR65### - ``sweeps the board with them.'' 
None of the Gryffindor team could think of anything to say for a moment. 
###CHAR50### was smirking so broadly ###CHAR50###'s cold eyes were reduced to slits. 
###DIALOGUE###``Oh, look,'' said Flint. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``A field invasion.'' 
###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### were crossing the grass to see what was going on. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What's happening?'' 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR68### asked ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Why aren't you playing? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###And what's ###CHAR0### doing here?'' 
###CHAR68### was looking at Malfoy, taking in his Slytherin Quidditch robes. 
###DIALOGUE###``I'm the new Slytherin Seeker, ###CHAR55###,'' said ###CHAR50###, smugly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Everyone's just been admiring the brooms my father's bought our team. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### gaped, open-mouthed, at the seven superb broomsticks in front of ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Good, aren't they?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR50### smoothly. 
###DIALOGUE###``But perhaps the Gryffindor team will be able to raise some gold and get new brooms, too. 
###DIALOGUE###You could raffle off those ###CHAR65### ; I expect a museum would bid for them.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The Slytherin team howled with laughter. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in,'' said ###CHAR25### sharply. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``They got in on pure talent.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The smug look on ###CHAR50###'s face flickered. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``No one asked your opinion, you fiIthy little Mudblood,'' ###CHAR50### spat. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### knew at once that ###CHAR50### had said something really bad because there was an instant uproar at ###CHAR50###'s words. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Flint had to dive in front of Malfoy to stop ###CHAR55### and ###CHAR19### jumping on ###CHAR55###, ###CHAR3### shrieked, ``How dare you!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###; and ###CHAR68### plunged ###CHAR68###'s hand into ###CHAR68###'s robes, pulled out ###CHAR68###'s wand, yelling, ``You'll pay for that one, Malfoy!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###and pointed it furiously under Flint's arm at ###CHAR30### face. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###A loud bang echoed around the stadium and a jet of green light shot out of the wrong end of ###CHAR68###'s wand, hitting ###CHAR68### in the stomach and sending ###CHAR68### reeling backward onto the grass. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR68###! 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR68###! 
###DIALOGUE###Are you all right?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###squealed ###CHAR25###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### opened ###CHAR68###'s mouth to speak, but no words came out. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Instead ###CHAR68### gave an almighty belch and several slugs dribbled out of ###CHAR68###'s mouth onto ###CHAR68###'s lap. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The Slytherin team were paralyzed with laughter. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Flint was doubled up, hanging onto his new broomstick for support. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR50### was on all fours, banging the ground with ###CHAR50###'s fist. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The Gryffindors were gathered around ###CHAR68###, who kept belching large, glistening slugs. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Nobody seemed to want to touch ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We'd better get ###CHAR68### to Hagrid's, it's nearest,'' said ###CHAR68### to ###CHAR25###, who nodded bravely, and the pair of them pulled ###CHAR68### up by the arms. 
###DIALOGUE###``What happened, ###CHAR68###? 
What happened? 
Is ###CHAR68### ill? 
###DIALOGUE###But you can cure ###CHAR68###, can't you?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR66### had run down from ###CHAR66###'s seat and was now dancing alongside them as they left the field. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### gave a huge heave and more slugs dribbled down ###CHAR68###'s front. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Oooh,'' said ###CHAR66###, fascinated and raising ###CHAR66###'s camera. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Can you hold ###CHAR68### still, ###CHAR68###?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Get out of the way, ###CHAR66###!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68### angrily. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### supported ###CHAR68### out of the stadium and across the grounds toward the edge of the forest. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Nearly there, ###CHAR68###,'' said ###CHAR25### as the gamekeeper's cabin came into view. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You'll be all right in a minute - almost there -'' They were within twenty feet of ###CHAR22###'s house when the front door opened, but it wasn't ###CHAR22### who emerged. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR73### , wearing robes of palest mauve today, came striding out. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Quick, behind here,'' ###CHAR68### hissed, dragging ###CHAR68### behind a nearby bush. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR25### followed, somewhat reluctantly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It's a simple matter if you know what you're doing!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR73### was saying loudly to ###CHAR22###. 
###DIALOGUE###``If you need help, you know where I am! 
I'll let you have a copy of my book. 
I'm surprised you haven't already got one - I'll sign one tonight and send it over. 
###DIALOGUE###Well, good-bye!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###And ###CHAR73### strode away toward the castle. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### waited until ###CHAR73### was out of sight, then pulled ###CHAR68### out of the ###CHAR75### and up to ###CHAR22###'s front door. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They knocked urgently. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR22### appeared at once, looking very grumpy, but ###CHAR68###'s expression brightened when ###CHAR68### saw who it was. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Bin wonderin' when you'd come ter see me - come in, come in - thought you mighta bin Professor ###CHAR73### back again -'' ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### supported ###CHAR68### over the threshold into the oneroomed cabin, which had an enormous bed in one corner, a fire crackling merrily in the other. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR22### didn't seem perturbed by ###CHAR68###'s slug problem, which ###CHAR68### hastily explained as ###CHAR68### lowered ###CHAR68### into a chair. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Better out than in,'' ###CHAR68### said cheerfully, plunking a large copper basin in front of ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Get 'em all up, ###CHAR68###.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I don't think there's anything to do except wait for it to stop,'' said ###CHAR25### anxiously, watching ###CHAR68### bend over the basin. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``That's a difficult curse to work at the best of times, but with a broken wand -'' ###CHAR22### was bustling around making them tea. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###'s boarhound, ###CHAR58###, was slobbering over ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What did ###CHAR73### want with you, ###CHAR22###?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### asked, scratching ###CHAR58###'s ears. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Givin' me advice on gettin' kelpies out of a well,'' growled ###CHAR22###, moving a half-plucked rooster off ###CHAR68###'s scrubbed table and setting down the teapot. 
###DIALOGUE###``Like I don' know. 
An' bangin' on about some banshee ###CHAR73### banished. 
###DIALOGUE###If one word of it was true, I'll eat my kettle.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It was most unlike ###CHAR22### to criticize a ###CHAR26###' teacher, and ###CHAR68### looked at ###CHAR68### in surprise. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR25###, however, said in a voice somewhat higher than usual, ``I think you're being a bit unfair. 
###DIALOGUE###Professor ###CHAR94### obviously thought ###CHAR94### was the best man for the job -'' ``###CHAR94### was the on' man for the job,'' said ###CHAR22###, offering them a Y plate of treacle fudge, while ###CHAR68### coughed squelchily into ###CHAR68###'s basin. 
###DIALOGUE###``An' I mean the on' one. 
Gettin' very difficult ter find anyone fer Y the Dark Arts job. 
People aren't too keen ter take it on, see. 
They're startin' ter think it's jinxed. 
No one's lasted long fer a while now. 
###DIALOGUE###So tell me,'' said ###CHAR22###, jerking ###CHAR68###'s head at ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Who was ###CHAR94### tryin' ter curse?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Malfoy called ###CHAR25### something - it must've been really bad, because everyone went wild.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It was bad,'' said ###CHAR68### hoarsely, emerging over the tabletop looking pale and sweaty. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Malfoy called ###CHAR25###'s `Mudblood,' Hagrid -'' ###CHAR68### dived out of sight again as a fresh wave of slugs made their appearance. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR22### looked outraged. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``He didn'!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### growled at ###CHAR25###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``He did,'' ###CHAR25### said. 
###DIALOGUE###``But I don't know what it means. 
###DIALOGUE###I could tell it was really rude, of course -'' ``It's about the most insulting thing he could think of,'' gasped ###CHAR68###, coming back up. 
###DIALOGUE###``Mudblood's a really foul name for someone who is Muggle-born - you know, non-magic parents. 
###DIALOGUE###There are some wizards - like ###CHAR50###'s family - who think they're better than everyone else because they're what people call pure-blood.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### gave a small burp, and a single slug fell into ###CHAR68###'s outstretched hand. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR68### threw it into the basin and continued, ``I mean, the rest of us know it doesn't make any difference at all. 
###DIALOGUE###Look at ###CHAR92### - ###CHAR92###'s pure-blood and ###CHAR92### can hardly stand a cauldron the right way up.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``An' they haven't invented a spell our Hermione can' do,'' said ###CHAR22### proudly, making ###CHAR25### go a brilliant shade of magenta. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It's a disgusting thing to call someone,'' said ###CHAR68###, wiping ###CHAR68###'s sweaty brow with a shaking hand. 
###DIALOGUE###``Dirty blood, see. 
Common blood. 
It's ridiculous. 
Most wizards these days are half-blood anyway. 
###DIALOGUE###If we hadn't married Muggles we'd've died out.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### retched and ducked out of sight again. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Well, I don' blame yeh fer tryin' ter curse ###CHAR92###, ###CHAR68###,'' said ###CHAR22### loudly over the thuds of more slugs hitting the basin. 
###DIALOGUE###``Bu' maybe it was a good thing yer wand backfired. 
###DIALOGUE###`Spect ###CHAR50### would've come marchin' up ter school if yeh'd cursed ###CHAR50###'s son. 
###DIALOGUE###Least yer not in trouble.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### would have pointed out that trouble didn't come much worse than having slugs pouring out of your mouth, but ###CHAR68### couldn't; ###CHAR22###'s treacle fudge had cemented ###CHAR68###'s jaws together. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Harry,'' said ###CHAR22### abruptly as though struck by a sudden thought. 
###DIALOGUE###``Gotta bone ter pick with yeh. 
I've heard you've bin givin' out signed photos. 
###DIALOGUE###How come I haven't got one?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Furious, ###CHAR68### wrenched ###CHAR68###'s teeth apart. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I have not been giving out signed photos,'' ###CHAR68### said hotly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``If ###CHAR73###'s still spreading that around -'' But then ###CHAR68### saw that ###CHAR22### was laughing. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I'm on'y jokin','' ###CHAR68### said, patting ###CHAR68### genially on the back and sending ###CHAR68### face first into the table. 
###DIALOGUE###``I knew yeh hadn't really. 
I told ###CHAR73### yeh didn' need teh. 
###DIALOGUE###Yer more famous than ###CHAR73### without tryin'.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Bet ###CHAR73### didn't like that,'' said ###CHAR68###, sitting up and rubbing ###CHAR68###'s chin. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Don' think he did,'' said ###CHAR22###, ###CHAR68###'s eyes twinkling. 
###DIALOGUE###``An' then I told him Id never read one o' his books an' he decided ter go. 
###DIALOGUE###Treacle fudge, ###CHAR68###?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### added as ###CHAR68### reappeared. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``No thanks,'' said ###CHAR68### weakly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Better not risk it.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Come an' see what I've bin growin','' said ###CHAR22### as ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### finished the last of their tea. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###In the small vegetable patch behind ###CHAR22###'s house were a dozen of the largest pumpkins ###CHAR68### had ever seen. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Each was the size of a large boulder. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Gettin' on well, aren't they?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR22### happily. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Fer the Halloween feast ... should be big enough by then.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What've you been feeding them?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR22### looked over ###CHAR68###'s shoulder to check that they were alone. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Well, I've bin givin' them - you know - a bit o' help -'' ###CHAR68### noticed ###CHAR22###'s flowery pink umbrella leaning against the back wall of the cabin. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### had had reason to believe before now that this umbrella was not all it looked; in fact, ###CHAR68### had the strong impression that ###CHAR22###'s old school wand was concealed inside it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR22### wasn't supposed to use magic. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### had been expelled from ###CHAR26### in ###CHAR68###'s third year, but ###CHAR68### had never found out why -any mention of the matter and ###CHAR22### would clear ###CHAR68###'s throat loudly and become mysteriously deaf until the subject was changed. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``An Engorgement Charm, I suppose?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR25###, halfway between disapproval and amusement. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Well, you've done a good job on them.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``That's what yer little sister said,'' said ###CHAR22###, nodding at ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Met her jus' yesterday.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR22### looked sideways at ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR68###'s beard twitching. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Said she was jus' lookin' round the grounds, but I reckon she was hopin' she might run inter someone else at my house.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### winked at Harry. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``If yeh ask me, she wouldn' say no ter a signed -'' ``Oh, shut up,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### snorted with laughter and the ground was sprayed with slugs. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Watch it!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR22### roared, pulling ###CHAR68### away from ###CHAR68###'s precious pumpkins. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It was nearly lunchtime and as ###CHAR68### had only had one bit of treacle fudge since dawn, ###CHAR68### was keen to go back to school to eat. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They said good-bye to ###CHAR22### and walked back up to the castle, ###CHAR68### hiccoughing occasionally, but only bringing up two very small slugs. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They had barely set foot in the cool entrance hall when a voice rang out, ``There you are, ###CHAR54### - ###CHAR55###.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Professor ###CHAR96### was walking toward them, looking stern. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You will both do your detentions this evening.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What're we doing, Professor?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68###, nervously suppressing a burp. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You will be polishing the silver in the trophy room with Mr. Filch,'' said Professor ###CHAR96###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``And no magic, ###CHAR55### - elbow grease.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### gulped. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Argus Filch, the caretaker, was loathed by every student in the school. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``And you, ###CHAR54###, will be helping Professor ###CHAR73### answer ###CHAR73###'s fan mail,'' said Professor ###CHAR96###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Oh n - Professor, can't I go and do the trophy room, too?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68### desperately. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Certainly not,'' said Professor ###CHAR96###, raising ###CHAR96###'s eyebrows. 
###DIALOGUE###``Professor ###CHAR73### requested you particularly. 
###DIALOGUE###Eight o'clock sharp, both of you.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### slouched into the Great Hall in states of deepest gloom, ###CHAR25### behind them, wearing a well-you-did-break-schoolrules sort of expression. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### didn't enjoy ###CHAR68###'s shepherd's pie as much as ###CHAR68###'d thought. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Both ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### felt they'd got the worse deal. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Filch'll have me there all night,'' said ###CHAR68### heavily. 
###DIALOGUE###``No magic! 
There must be about a hundred cups in that room. 
###DIALOGUE###I'm no good at Muggle cleaning.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I'd swap anytime,'' said ###CHAR68### hollowly. 
###DIALOGUE###``I've had loads of practice with the ###CHAR88###. 
###DIALOGUE###Answering ###CHAR73###'s fan mail ... ###CHAR73###'ll be a nightmare ...'' Saturday afternoon seemed to melt away, and in what seemed like no time, it was five minutes to eight, and ###CHAR68### was dragging ###CHAR68###'s feet along the second-floor corridor to ###CHAR73###'s office. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### gritted ###CHAR68###'s teeth and knocked. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The door flew open at once. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR73### beamed down at ###CHAR73###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Ah, here's the scalawag!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR73### said. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Come in, ###CHAR68###, come in -'' Shining brightly on the walls by the light of many candles were countless framed photographs of ###CHAR73###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR73### had even signed a few of them. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Another large pile lay on ###CHAR73###'s desk. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You can address the envelopes!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR73### told ###CHAR68###, as though this was a huge treat. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``This first one's to Gladys Gudgeon, bless her - huge fan of mine -'' The minutes snailed by. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Harry let Lockhart's voice wash over him, occasionally saying, ``Mmm'' and ``Right'' and ``Yeah.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Now and then he caught a phrase like, ``Fame's a fickle friend, ###CHAR68###,'' or ``Celebrity is as celebrity does, remember that.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The candles burned lower and lower, making the light dance over the many moving faces of ###CHAR73### watching ###CHAR73###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### moved ###CHAR68###'s aching hand over what felt like the thousandth envelope, writing out ###CHAR15### 's address. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It must be nearly time to leave, ###CHAR68### thought miserably, please let it be nearly time... And then ###CHAR68### heard something - something quite apart from the spitting of the dying candles and ###CHAR73###'s prattle about ###CHAR73###'s fans. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It was a voice, a voice to chill the bone marrow, a voice of breathtaking, ice-cold venom. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Come ... come to me... Let me rip you... Let me tear you ... Let me kill you ...'' ###CHAR68### gave a huge jump and a large lilac blot appeared on ###CHAR15### 's street. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### said loudly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I know!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR73###. 
###DIALOGUE###``Six solid months at the top of the bestseller list! 
###DIALOGUE###Broke all records!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``No,'' said ###CHAR68### frantically. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``That voice!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Sorry?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR73###, looking puzzled. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What voice?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``That - that voice that said - didn't you hear it?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR73### was looking at Harry in high astonishment. 
###DIALOGUE###``What are you talking about, ###CHAR68###? 
Perhaps you're getting a litde drowsy? 
Great Scott - look at the time! 
We've been here nearly four hours! 
###DIALOGUE###Id never have believed it - the time's flown, hasn't it?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### didn't answer. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### was straining ###CHAR68###'s ears to hear the voice again, but there was no sound now except for ###CHAR73### telling ###CHAR73### mustn't expect a treat like this every time ###CHAR73### got detention. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Feeling dazed, ###CHAR68### left. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It was so late that the Gryffindor common room was almost empty. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### went straight up to the dormitory. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### wasn't back yet. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### pulled on ###CHAR68###'s pajamas, got into bed, and waited. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Half an hour later, ###CHAR68### arrived, nursing ###CHAR68###'s right arm and bringing a strong smell of polish into the darkened room. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``My muscles have all seized up,'' ###CHAR68### groaned, sinking on ###CHAR68###'s bed. 
###DIALOGUE###``Fourteen times he made me buff up that Quidditch cup before he was satisfied. 
And then I had another slug attack all over a Special Award for Services to the School. 
###DIALOGUE###Took ages to get the slime off... How was it with ###CHAR73###?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Keeping ###CHAR68###'s voice low so as not to wake ###CHAR92###, ###CHAR28###, and ###CHAR4###, ###CHAR68### told ###CHAR68### exactly what ###CHAR68### had heard. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``And ###CHAR73### said ###CHAR73### couldn't hear it?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### could see ###CHAR68### frowning in the moonlight. 
###DIALOGUE###``D'you think ###CHAR73### was lying? 
###DIALOGUE###But I don't get it - even someone invisible would've had to open the door.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I know,'' said ###CHAR68###, lying back in ###CHAR68###'s four-poster and staring at the canopy above ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I don't get it either.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###October arrived, spreading a damp chill over the grounds and into the castle. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR98### , the nurse, was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds among the staff and students. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR98###'s Pepperup potion worked instantly, though it left the drinker smoking at the ears for several hours afterward. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR76### , who had been looking pale, was bullied into taking some by ###CHAR70###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The steam pouring from under ###CHAR76###'s vivid hair gave the impression that ###CHAR76###'s whole head was on fire. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Raindrops the size of bullets thundered on the castle windows for days on end; the lake rose, the flower beds turned into muddy streams, and ###CHAR22###'s pumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR43### 's enthusiasm for regular training sessions, however, was not dampened, which was why ###CHAR68### was to be found, late one stormy Saturday afternoon a few days before Halloween, returning to ###CHAR81### , drenched to the skin and splattered with mud.
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Even aside from the rain and wind it hadn't been a happy practice session. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR55### and ###CHAR19###, who had been spying on the Slytherin team, had seen for themselves the speed of those new Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They reported that the Slytherin team was no more than seven greenish blurs, shooting through the air like missiles. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###As ###CHAR68### squelched along the deserted corridor ###CHAR68### came across somebody who looked just as preoccupied as ###CHAR68### was. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Nearly Headless ###CHAR29###, the ghost of Gryffindor Tower, was staring morosely out of a window, muttering under ###CHAR29###'s breath, ''... don't fulfill their requirements ... half an inch, if that ...'' ``Hello, ###CHAR29###,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Hello, hello,'' said Nearly Headless ###CHAR29###, starting and looking round. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR29### wore a dashing, plumed hat on ###CHAR29###'s long curly hair, and a tunic with a ruff, which concealed the fact that ###CHAR29###'s neck was almost completely severed. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR29### was pale as smoke, and ###CHAR68### could see right through ###CHAR68### to the dark sky and torrential rain outside. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You look troubled, young ###CHAR54###,'' said ###CHAR29###, folding a transparent letter as ###CHAR29### spoke and tucking it inside ###CHAR29###'s doublet. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``So do you,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Ah,'' Nearly Headless ###CHAR29### waved an elegant hand, ``a matter of no importance... It's not as though I really wanted to join... Thought I'd apply, but apparently I `don't fulfill requirements' -'' In spite of ###CHAR29###'s airy tone, there was a look of great bitterness on ###CHAR29###'s face. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But you would think, wouldn't you,'' ###CHAR29### erupted suddenly, pulling the letter back out of ###CHAR29###'s pocket, ``that getting hit forty-five times in the neck with a blunt axe would qualify you to join the Headless Hunt?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Oh - yes,'' said ###CHAR68###, who was obviously supposed to agree. 
###DIALOGUE###``I mean, nobody wishes more than I do that it had all been quick and clean, and my head had come off properly, I mean, it would have saved me a great deal of pain and ridicule. 
However -'' Nearly Headless ###CHAR29### shook ###CHAR29###'s letter open and read furiously: ''`We can only accept huntsmen whose heads have parted company with their bodies. 
You will appreciate that it would be impossible otherwise for members to participate in hunt activities such as Horseback Head-Juggling and Head Polo. 
It is with the greatest regret, therefore, that I must inform you that you do not fulfill our requirements. 
###DIALOGUE###With very best wishes, Sir Patrick Delaney-Podmore.''' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Fuming, Nearly Headless ###CHAR29### stuffed the letter away. 
###DIALOGUE###``Half an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on, ###CHAR68###! 
###DIALOGUE###Most people would think that's good and beheaded, but oh, no, it's not enough for Sir Properly Decapitated-Podmore.'' 
###DIALOGUE###Nearly Headless ###CHAR29### took several deep breaths and then said, in a far calmer tone, ``So - what's bothering you? 
###DIALOGUE###Anything I can do?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``No,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Not unless you know where we can get seven free Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones for our match against Sly -'' The rest of ###CHAR68###'s sentence was drowned out by a high-pitched mewling from somewhere near ###CHAR68###'s ankles. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### looked down and found himself gazing into a pair of lamp-like yellow eyes. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It was ###CHAR34### , the skeletal gray cat who was used by the caretaker, ###CHAR10### , as a sort of deputy in his endless battle against students. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You'd better get out of here, ###CHAR68###,'' said ###CHAR29### quickly. 
###DIALOGUE###``Filch isn't in a good mood - ###CHAR68###'s got the flu and some third years accidentally plastered frog brains all over the ceiling in dungeon five. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR68###'s been cleaning all morning, and if ###CHAR68### sees you dripping mud all over the place -'' ``Right,'' said ###CHAR68###, backing away from the accusing stare of ###CHAR34### , but not quickly enough. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Drawn to the spot by the mysterious power that seemed to connect ###CHAR68### with ###CHAR68###'s foul cat, Argus Filch burst suddenly through a tapestry to ###CHAR68###'s right, wheezing and looking wildly about for the rule-breaker. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There was a thick tartan scarf bound around ###CHAR68###'s head, and ###CHAR68###'s nose was unusually purple. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Filth!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### shouted, ###CHAR68###'s jowls aquiver, ###CHAR68###'s eyes popping alarmingly as ###CHAR68### pointed at the muddy puddle that had dripped from ###CHAR68###'s Quidditch robes. 
###DIALOGUE###``Mess and muck everywhere! 
I've had enough of it, I tell you! 
###DIALOGUE###Follow me, ###CHAR54###!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###So ###CHAR68### waved a gloomy good-bye to Nearly Headless ###CHAR29### and followed Filch back downstairs, doubling the number of muddy footprints on the floor. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### had never been inside Filch's office before; it was a place most students avoided. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The room was dingy and windowless, lit by a single oil lamp dangling from the low ceiling. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###A faint smell of fried fish lingered about the place. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Wooden filing cabinets stood around the walls; from their labels, ###CHAR68### could see that they contained details of every pupil Filch had ever punished. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR55### and ###CHAR19### had an entire drawer to themselves. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###A highly polished collection of chains and manacles hung on the wall behind Filch's desk. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It was common knowledge that ###CHAR55### was always begging ###CHAR94### to let ###CHAR55### suspend students by their ankles from the ceiling. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Filch grabbed a quill from a pot on ###CHAR55###'s desk and began shuffling around looking for parchment. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Dung,'' ###CHAR55### muttered furiously, ``great sizzling dragon bogies ... frog brains ... rat intestines ... I've had enough of it ... make an example ... where's the form ... yes ...'' ###CHAR55### retrieved a large roll of parchment from ###CHAR55###'s desk drawer and stretched it out in front of ###CHAR55###, dipping ###CHAR55###'s long black quill into the ink pot. 
###DIALOGUE###``Name ... ###CHAR54### . 
###DIALOGUE###Crime ...'' ``It was only a bit of mud!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It's only a bit of mud to you, boy, but to me it's an extra hour scrubbing!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###shouted Filch, a drip shivering unpleasantly at the end of ###CHAR68###'s bulbous nose. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Crime ... befouling the castle ... suggested sentence ...'' Dabbing at ###CHAR68###'s streaming nose, Filch squinted unpleasantly at ###CHAR68### who waited with bated breath for ###CHAR68###'s sentence to fall. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###But as Filch lowered ###CHAR68###'s quill, there was a great BANG! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###on the ceiling of the office, which made the oil lamp rattle. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``PEEVES!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Filch roared, flinging down ###CHAR68###'s quill in a transport of rage. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I'll have you this time, I'll have you!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###And without a backward glance at ###CHAR68###, Filch ran flat-footed from the office, ###CHAR34### streaking alongside ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Peeves was the school poltergeist, a grinning, airborne menace who lived to cause havoc and distress. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### didn't much like Peeves, but couldn't help feeling grateful for ###CHAR68###'s timing. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Hopefully, whatever Peeves had done -LRB-and it sounded as though ###CHAR68###'d wrecked something very big this time-RRB- would distract Filch from ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Thinking that ###CHAR68### should probably wait for Filch to come back, ###CHAR68### sank into a moth-eaten chair next to the desk. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There was only one thing on it apart from ###CHAR68###'s half-completed form: a large, glossy, purple envelope with silver lettering on the front. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###With a quick glance at the door to check that Filch wasn't on ###CHAR68###'s way back, ###CHAR68### picked up the envelope and read: kwikspell A Correspondence Course in Beginners' Magic. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Intrigued, ###CHAR68### flicked the envelope open and pulled out the sheaf of parchment inside. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###More curly silver writing on the front page said: Feel out of step in the world of modern magic? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Find yourself making excuses not to perform simple spells? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Ever been taunted for your woeful wandwork? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There is an answer! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Kwikspell is an all-new, fail-safe, quick-result, easy-learn course. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Hundreds of witches and wizards have benefited from the Kwikspell method! 
###DIALOGUE###Madam Z. Nettles of Topsham writes: ``I had no memory for incantations and my potions were a family joke! 
###DIALOGUE###Now, after a Kwikspell course, I am the center of attention at parties and friends beg for the recipe of my Scintillation Solution!'' 
###DIALOGUE###Warlock D. J. Prod of Didsbury says: ``My wife used to sneer at my feeble charms, but one month into your fabulous Kwikspell course and I succeeded in turning her into a yak! 
###DIALOGUE###Thank you, Kwikspell!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Fascinated, ###CHAR68### thumbed through the rest of the envelope's contents. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Why on earth did Filch want a Kwikspell course? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Did this mean ###CHAR68### wasn't a proper wizard? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### was just reading ``Lesson One: Holding Your Wand -LRB-Some Useful Tips-RRB-'' when shuffling footsteps outside told ###CHAR68### Filch was coming back. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Stuffing the parchment back into the envelope, ###CHAR68### threw it back onto the desk just as the door opened. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Filch was looking triumphant. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``That vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### was saying gleefully to ###CHAR34### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We'll have Peeves out this time, my sweet -'' ###CHAR68###'s eyes fell on ###CHAR68### and then darted to the Kwikspell envelope, which, ###CHAR68### realized too late, was lying two feet away from where it had started. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Filch's pasty face went brick red. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### braced himself for a tidal wave of fury. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Filch hobbled across to ###CHAR68###'s desk, snatched up the envelope, and threw it into a drawer. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Have you - did you read -?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### sputtered. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``No,'' ###CHAR68### lied quickly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Filch's knobbly hands were twisting together. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``If I thought you'd read my private - not that it's mine - for a friend - be that as it may - however -'' ###CHAR68### was staring at ###CHAR68###, alarmed; Filch had never looked madder. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###'s eyes were popping, a tic was going in one of ###CHAR68###'s pouchy cheeks, and the tartan scarf didn't help. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Very well - go - and don't breathe a word - not that - however, if you didn't read - go now, I have to write up Peeves' report - go -'' Amazed at ###CHAR68###'s luck, ###CHAR68### sped out of the office, up the corridor, and back upstairs. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###To escape from Filch's office without punishment was probably some kind of school record. 
###DIALOGUE###``Harry! 
###CHAR68###! 
###DIALOGUE###Did it work?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Nearly Headless ###CHAR29### came gliding out of a classroom. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Behind ###CHAR29###, ###CHAR68### could see the wreckage of a large black-and-gold cabinet that appeared to have been dropped from a great height. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I persuaded Peeves to crash it right over Filch's office,'' said ###CHAR29### eagerly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Thought it might distract ###CHAR68### -'' ``Was that you?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68### gratefully. 
###DIALOGUE###``Yeah, it worked, I didn't even get detention. 
###DIALOGUE###Thanks, ###CHAR29###!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They set off up the corridor together. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Nearly Headless ###CHAR29###, ###CHAR68### noticed, was still holding Sir ###CHAR87###'s rejection letter.
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I wish there was something I could do for you about the Headless Hunt,'' ###CHAR68### said. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Nearly Headless ###CHAR29### stopped in ###CHAR68###'s tracks and ###CHAR68### walked right through ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### wished ###CHAR68### hadn't; it was like stepping through an icy shower. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But there is something you could do for me,'' said ###CHAR29### excitedly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Harry - would I be asking too much - but no, you wouldn't want -'' ``What is it?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Well, this Halloween will be my five hundredth deathday,'' said Nearly Headless ###CHAR29###, drawing himself up and looking dignified. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Oh,'' said ###CHAR68###, not sure whether ###CHAR68### should look sorry or happy about this. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Right.'' 
###DIALOGUE###``I'm holding a party down in one of the roomier dungeons. 
Friends will be coming from all over the country. 
It would be such an honor if you would attend. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR84### and ###CHAR25### would be most welcome, too, of course - but I daresay you'd rather go to the school feast?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### watched ###CHAR68### on tenterhooks. 
###DIALOGUE###``No,'' said ###CHAR68### quickly, ``I'll come -'' ``My dear boy! 
###CHAR54### , at my deathday party! 
###DIALOGUE###And'' - ###CHAR68### hesitated, looking excited - ``do you think you could possibly mention to Sir ###CHAR87### how very frightening and impressive you find me?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Of - of course,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Nearly Headless ###CHAR29### beamed at ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``A deathday party?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR25### keenly when ###CHAR68### had changed at last and joined ###CHAR25### and ###CHAR68### in the common room. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I bet there aren't many living people who can say they've been to one of those - it'll be fascinating!''
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Why would anyone want to celebrate the day they died?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68###, who was halfway through ###CHAR68###'s Potions homework and grumpy. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Sounds dead depressing to me...'' Rain was still lashing the windows, which were now inky black, but inside all looked bright and cheerful. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The firelight glowed over the countless squashy armchairs where people sat reading, talking, doing homework or, in the case of ###CHAR55### and ###CHAR19### , trying to find out what would happen if you fed a Filibuster firework to a salamander. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR55### had ``rescued'' the brilliant orange, fire-dwelling lizard from a Care of Magical Creatures class and it was now smouldering gently on a table surrounded by a knot of curious people. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### was at the point of telling ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### about Filch and the Kwikspell course when the salamander suddenly whizzed into the air, emitting loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the room. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The sight of ###CHAR70### bellowing himself hoarse at ###CHAR55### and ###CHAR19###, the spectacular display of tangerine stars showering from the salamander's mouth, and its escape into the fire, with accompanying explosions, drove both Filch and the Kwikspell envelope from ###CHAR68###'s mind. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###By the time Halloween arrived, ###CHAR68### was regretting ###CHAR68###'s rash promise to go to the deathday party. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The rest of the school was happily anticipating their Halloween feast; the Great Hall had been decorated with the usual live bats, ###CHAR22###'s vast pumpkins had been carved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit in, and there were rumors that ###CHAR94### had booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for the entertainment. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``A promise is a promise,'' ###CHAR25### reminded ###CHAR68### bossily. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You said you'd go to the deathday party.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###So at seven o'clock, ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR68###, and ###CHAR25### walked straight past the doorway to the packed Great Hall, which was glittering invitingly with gold plates and candles, and directed their steps instead toward the dungeons. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The passageway leading to Nearly Headless ###CHAR29###'s party had been lined with candles, too, though the effect was far from cheerful: These were long, thin, jet-black tapers, all burning bright blue, casting a dim, ghostly light even over their own living faces. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The temperature dropped with every step they took. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###As ###CHAR68### shivered and drew ###CHAR68###'s robes tightly around ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR68### heard what sounded like a thousand fingernails scraping an enormous blackboard. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Is that supposed to be music?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### whispered. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They turned a corner and saw Nearly Headless ###CHAR29### standing at a doorway hung with black velvet drapes. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``My dear friends,'' ###CHAR29### said mournfully. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Welcome, welcome ... so pleased you could come...'' ###CHAR29### swept off ###CHAR29###'s plumed hat and bowed them inside. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It was an incredible sight. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The dungeon was full of hundreds of pearly-white, translucent people, mostly drifting around a crowded dance floor, waltzing to the dreadful, quavering sound of thirty musical saws, played by an orchestra on a raised, black-draped platform. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###A chandelier overhead blazed midnight-blue with a thousand more black candles. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Their breath rose in a mist before them; it was like stepping into a freezer. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Shall we have a look around?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### suggested, wanting to warm up ###CHAR68###'s feet. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Careful not to walk through anyone,'' said ###CHAR68### nervously, and they set off around the edge of the dance floor. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They passed a group of gloomy nuns, a ragged man wearing chains, and the Fat Friar, a cheerful ###CHAR80### ghost, who was talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### wasn't surprised to see that the Bloody Baron, a gaunt, staring Slytherin ghost covered in silver bloodstains, was being given a wide berth by the other ghosts. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Oh, no,'' said ###CHAR25###, stopping abruptly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Turn back, turn back, I don't want to talk to Moaning Myrtle -'' ``Who?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68### as they backtracked quickly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``She haunts one of the toilets in the girls' bathroom on the first floor,'' said ###CHAR25###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``She haunts a toilet?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Yes. 
It's been out-of-order all year because she keeps having tantrums and flooding the place. 
###DIALOGUE###I never went in there anyway if I could avoid it; it's awful trying to have a pee with her wailing at you -'' ``Look, food!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###On the other side of the dungeon was a long table, also covered in black velvet. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They approached it eagerly but next moment had stopped in their tracks, horrified. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The smell was quite disgusting. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Large, rotten fish were laid on handsome silver platters; cakes, burned charcoal-black, were heaped on salvers; there was a great maggoty haggis, a slab of cheese covered in furry green mold and, in pride of place, an enormous gray cake in the shape of a tombstone, with tar-like icing forming the words, Sir Nicholas de Mimsy- Porpington died 31st October, 1492 ###CHAR68### watched, amazed, as a portly ghost approached the table, crouched low, and walked through it, ###CHAR68###'s mouth held wide so that it passed through one of the stinking salmon. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Can you taste it if you walk though it?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### asked ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Almost,'' said the ghost sadly, and ###CHAR68### drifted away. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I expect they've let it rot to give it a stronger flavor,'' said ###CHAR25### knowledgeably, pinching ###CHAR25###'s nose and leaning closer to look at the putrid haggis. 
###DIALOGUE###``Can we move? 
###DIALOGUE###I feel sick,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They had barely turned around, however, when a little man swooped suddenly from under the table and came to a halt in midair before them. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Hello, Peeves,'' said ###CHAR68### cautiously. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Unlike the ghosts around them, Peeves the Poltergeist was the very reverse of pale and transparent. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### was wearing a bright orange party hat, a revolving bow tie, and a broad grin on ###CHAR68###'s wide, wicked face. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Nibbles?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### said sweetly, offering them a bowl of peanuts covered in fungus. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``No thanks,'' said ###CHAR25###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Heard you talking about poor Myrtle,'' said ###CHAR24###, ###CHAR68###'s eyes dancing. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Rude you was about poor Myrtle.'' 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR68### took a deep breath and bellowed, ``OY! 
###DIALOGUE###MYRTLE!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Oh, no, Peeves, don't tell her what I said, she'll be really upset,'' ###CHAR25### whispered frantically. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I didn't mean it, I don't mind her - er, hello, Myrtle.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The squat ghost of a girl had glided over. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###She had the glummest face ###CHAR68### had ever seen, half-hidden behind lank hair and thick, pearly spectacles. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###she said sulkily. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``How are you, ###CHAR20###?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR25### in a falsely bright voice. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It's nice to see you out of the toilet.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Myrtle sniffed. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR25### was just talking about you -'' said Peeves slyly in Myrtle's ear. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Just saying - saying - how nice you look tonight,'' said ###CHAR25###, glaring at Peeves. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Myrtle eyed ###CHAR25### suspiciously. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You're making fun of me,'' she said, silver tears welling rapidly in her small, see-through eyes. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``No - honestly - didn't I just say how nice Myrtle's looking?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR25###, nudging ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### painfully in the ribs. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Oh, yeah -'' ``She did -'' ``Don't lie to me,'' ###CHAR20### gasped, tears now flooding down ###CHAR20###'s face, while ###CHAR24### chuckled happily over ###CHAR20###'s shoulder. 
###DIALOGUE###``D'you think I don't know what people call me behind my back? 
Fat Myrtle! 
Ugly Myrtle! 
###DIALOGUE###Miserable, moaning, moping Myrtle!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You've forgotten pimply,'' Peeves hissed in ###CHAR20###'s ear. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Moaning Myrtle burst into anguished sobs and fled from the dungeon. 
###DIALOGUE###Peeves shot after her, pelting her with moldy peanuts, yelling, ``Pimply! 
###DIALOGUE###Pimply!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Oh, dear,'' said ###CHAR25### sadly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Nearly Headless ###CHAR29### now drifted toward them through the crowd. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Enjoying yourselves?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Oh, yes,'' they lied. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Not a bad turnout,'' said Nearly Headless ###CHAR29### proudly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``The Wailing Widow came all the way up from Kent... It's nearly time for my speech, I'd better go and warn the orchestra...'' The orchestra, however, stopped playing at that very moment. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They, and everyone else in the dungeon, fell silent, looking around in excitement, as a hunting horn sounded. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Oh, here we go,'' said Nearly Headless ###CHAR29### bitterly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Through the dungeon wall burst a dozen ghost horses, each ridden by a headless horseman. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The assembly clapped wildly; ###CHAR68### started to clap, too, but stopped quickly at the sight of ###CHAR29###'s face. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The horses galloped into the middle of the dance floor and halted, rearing and plunging. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###At the front of the pack was a large ghost who held ###CHAR29###'s bearded head under ###CHAR29###'s arm, from which position ###CHAR29### was blowing the horn. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The ghost leapt down, lifted ###CHAR29###'s head high in the air so ###CHAR29### could see over the crowd -LRB-everyone laughed-RRB-, and strode over to Nearly Headless ###CHAR29###, squashing ###CHAR29###'s head back onto ###CHAR29###'s neck. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR29###!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR29### roared. 
###DIALOGUE###``How are you? 
###DIALOGUE###Head still hanging in there?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR29### gave a hearty guffaw and clapped Nearly Headless ###CHAR29### on the shoulder. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Welcome, ###CHAR87###,'' said ###CHAR29### stiffly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Live `uns!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said Sir ###CHAR87###, spotting ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR68###, and ###CHAR25### and giving a huge, fake jump of astonishment, so that ###CHAR29###'s head fell off again -LRB-the crowd howled with laughter-RRB-. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Very amusing,'' said Nearly Headless ###CHAR29### darkly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Don't mind ###CHAR29###!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###shouted Sir ###CHAR87###'s head from the floor. 
###DIALOGUE###``Still upset we won't let ###CHAR29### join the Hunt! 
###DIALOGUE###But I mean to say - look at the fellow -'' ``I think,'' said ###CHAR68### hurriedly, at a meaningful look from ###CHAR29###, ``###CHAR29###'s very - frightening and - er -'' ``Ha!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###yelled Sir ###CHAR87###'s head. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Bet ###CHAR29### asked you to say that!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``If I could have everyone's attention, it's time for my speech!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said Nearly Headless ###CHAR29### loudly, striding toward the podium and climbing into an icy blue spotlight. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``My late lamented lords, ladies, and gentlemen, it is my great sorrow ...'' But nobody heard much more. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Sir ###CHAR87### and the rest of the Headless Hunt had just started a game of Head Hockey and the crowd were turning to watch. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Nearly Headless ###CHAR29### tried vainly to recapture ###CHAR29###'s audience, but gave up as Sir ###CHAR87###'s head went sailing past ###CHAR29### to loud cheers. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### was very cold by now, not to mention hungry. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I can't stand much more of this,'' ###CHAR68### muttered, ###CHAR68###'s teeth chattering, as the orchestra ground back into action and the ghosts swept back onto the dance floor. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Let's go,'' ###CHAR68### agreed. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They backed toward the door, nodding and beaming at anyone who looked at them, and a minute later were hurrying back up the passageway full of black candles. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Pudding might not be finished yet,'' said ###CHAR68### hopefully, leading the way toward the steps to the entrance hall. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###And then ###CHAR68### heard it. ''
###DIALOGUE###... rip ... tear ... kill ...'' It was the same voice, the same cold, murderous voice ###CHAR68### had heard in ###CHAR73###'s office. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### stumbled to a halt, clutching at the stone wall, listening with all ###CHAR68###'s might, looking around, squinting up and down the dimly lit passageway. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Harry, what're you -?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It's that voice again - shut up a minute -'' ''... soo hungry ... for so long ...'' ``Listen!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68### urgently, and ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### froze, watching ###CHAR68###. ''
###DIALOGUE###... kill ... time to kill ...'' The voice was growing fainter. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### was sure it was moving away - moving upward. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###A mixture of fear and excitement gripped ###CHAR68### as ###CHAR68### stared at the dark ceiling; how could it be moving upward? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Was it a phantom, to whom stone ceilings didn't matter? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``This way,'' ###CHAR68### shouted, and ###CHAR68### began to run, up the stairs, into the entrance hall. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It was no good hoping to hear anything here, the babble of talk from the Halloween feast was echoing out of the Great Hall. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### sprinted up the marble staircase to the first floor, ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### clattering behind ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR68###, what're we -'' ``SHH!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### strained ###CHAR68###'s ears. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Distantly, from the floor above, and growing fainter still, ###CHAR68### heard the voice: ''... I smell blood... I SMELL BLOOD!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###'s stomach lurched - ``It's going to kill someone!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### shouted, and ignoring ###CHAR68###'s and ###CHAR25###'s bewildered faces, ###CHAR68### ran up the next flight of steps three at a time, trying to listen over ###CHAR68###'s own pounding footsteps - ###CHAR68### hurtled around the whole of the second floor, ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### panting behind ###CHAR68###, not stopping until they turned a corner into the last, deserted passage. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR68###, what was that all about?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68###, wiping sweat off ###CHAR68###'s face. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I couldn't hear anything...'' But ###CHAR25### gave a sudden gasp, pointing down the corridor. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Look!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Something was shining on the wall ahead. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They approached slowly, squinting through the darkness. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Foot-high words had been daubed on the wall between two windows, shimmering in the light cast by the flaming torches. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###the chamber of secrets has been opened. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###enemies of the heir, beware. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What's that thing - hanging underneath?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68###, a slight quiver in ###CHAR68###'s voice. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###As they edged nearer, ###CHAR68### almost slipped - there was a large puddle of water on the floor; ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### grabbed ###CHAR68###, and they inched toward the message, eyes fixed on a dark shadow beneath it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###All three of them realized what it was at once, and leapt backward with a splash.
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###.
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR34### , the caretaker's cat, was hanging by ###CHAR34###'s tail from the torch bracket. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR34### was stiff as a board, ###CHAR34###'s eyes wide and staring. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###For a few seconds, they didn't move. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Then ###CHAR68### said, ``Let's get out of here.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Shouldn't we try and help -'' ###CHAR68### began awkwardly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Trust me,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We don't want to be found here.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###But it was too late. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###A rumble, as though of distant thunder, told them that the feast had just ended. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###From either end of the corridor where they stood came the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the stairs, and the loud, happy talk of well-fed people; next moment, students were crashing into the passage from both ends. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The chatter, the bustle, the noise died suddenly as the people in front spotted the hanging cat. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###, ###CHAR68###, and ###CHAR25### stood alone, in the middle of the corridor, as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to see the grisly sight. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Then someone shouted through the quiet. 
###DIALOGUE###``Enemies of the Heir, beware! 
###DIALOGUE###You'll be next, Mudbloods!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It was ###CHAR0### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR0### had pushed to the front of the crowd, ###CHAR0###'s cold eyes alive, ###CHAR0###'s usually bloodless face flushed, as ###CHAR0### grinned at the sight of the hanging, immobile cat.
THE WRITING ON THE WALL
What's going on here? 
###DIALOGUE###What's going on?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Attracted no doubt by ###CHAR50###'s shout, ###CHAR10### came shouldering ###CHAR50###'s way through the crowd. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Then ###CHAR50### saw ###CHAR34### and fell back, clutching ###CHAR50###'s face in horror. 
###DIALOGUE###``My cat! 
My cat! 
###DIALOGUE###What's happened to ###CHAR34### ?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR50### shrieked. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###And ###CHAR50###'s popping eyes fell on ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``You!
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``he screeched. 
###DIALOGUE###``You! 
You've murdered my cat! 
You've killed ###CHAR34###'s ! 
I'll kill you! 
###DIALOGUE###I'll -'' ``Argus!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR94### had arrived on the scene, followed by a number of other teachers. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###In seconds, ###CHAR94### had swept past ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR68###, and ###CHAR25### and detached ###CHAR34### from the torch bracket. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Come with me, Argus,'' ###CHAR68### said to Filch. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You, too, ###CHAR95### , ###CHAR84### , ###CHAR25### .'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR73### stepped forward eagerly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``My office is nearest, Headmaster - just upstairs - please feel free -'' ``Thank you, ###CHAR73###,'' said ###CHAR94###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The silent crowd parted to let them pass. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR73###, looking excited and important, hurried after ###CHAR94###; so did Professors McGonagall and ###CHAR63###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###As they entered ###CHAR73###'s darkened office there was a flurry of movement across the walls; ###CHAR68### saw several of the ###CHAR52### in the pictures dodging out of sight, their hair in rollers. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The real ###CHAR73### lit the candles on ###CHAR73###'s desk and stood back. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR94### lay ###CHAR34### on the polished surface and began to examine ###CHAR34###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###, ###CHAR68###, and ###CHAR25### exchanged tense looks and sank into chairs outside the pool of candlelight, watching. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The tip of ###CHAR94###'s long, crooked nose was barely an inch from ###CHAR34### 's fur. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR94### was looking at ###CHAR34###'s closely through ###CHAR94###'s half-moon spectacles, ###CHAR94###'s long fingers gently prodding and poking. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Professor ###CHAR96### was bent almost as close, ###CHAR34###'s eyes narrowed. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR63### loomed behind them, half in shadow, wearing a most peculiar expression: It was as though ###CHAR63### was trying hard not to smile. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###And ###CHAR73### was hovering around all of them, making suggestions. 
###DIALOGUE###``It was definitely a curse that killed ###CHAR25### - probably the Transmogrifian Torture - I've seen it used many times, so unlucky I wasn't there, I know the very countercurse that would have saved ###CHAR25### . 
... ###CHAR73###'s comments were punctuated by Filch's dry, racking sobs. 
###CHAR73### was slumped in a chair by the desk, unable to look at ###CHAR34### , ###CHAR73###'s face in ###CHAR73###'s hands. 
Much as ###CHAR73### detested Filch, ###CHAR68### couldn't help feeling a bit sorry for ###CHAR68###, though not nearly as sorry as ###CHAR68### felt for himself If ###CHAR94### believed Filch, ###CHAR94### would be expelled for sure. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR94### was now muttering strange words under ###CHAR94###'s breath and tapping ###CHAR34### with ###CHAR94###'s wand but nothing happened: ###CHAR34### continued to look as though ###CHAR34### had been recently stuffed. ''
###DIALOGUE###... I remember something very similar happening in Ouagadogou,'' said ###CHAR73###, ``a series of attacks, the full story's in my autobiography, I was able to provide the townsfolk with various amulets, which cleared the matter up at once ...'' The photographs of ###CHAR73### on the walls were all nodding in agreement as ###CHAR73### talked. 
One of them had forgotten to remove ###CHAR73###'s hair net. 
At last ###CHAR94### straightened up. 
###DIALOGUE###``###CHAR34###'s not dead, Argus,'' ###CHAR94### said softly. 
###CHAR73### stopped abruptly in the middle of counting the number of murders ###CHAR73### had prevented. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Not dead?'' 
choked Filch, looking through ###CHAR73###'s fingers at ###CHAR34### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But why's ###CHAR34### all - all stiff and frozen?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR34### has been Petrified,'' said ###CHAR94### -LRB-``Ah! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I thought so!'' 
said ###CHAR73###-RRB-. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But how, I cannot say ...'' ``Ask ###CHAR34###!'' 
shrieked Filch, turning ###CHAR73###'s blotched and tearstained face to ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``No second year could have done this,'' said ###CHAR94### firmly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``it would take Dark Magic of the most advanced -'' ``###CHAR34### did it, ###CHAR34### did it!'' 
Filch spat, ###CHAR94###'s pouchy face purpling. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You saw what ###CHAR34### wrote on the wall! 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR34### found - in my office - ###CHAR34### knows I'm a - I'm a -'' Filch's face worked horribly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR34### knows I'm a Squib!'' 
###CHAR94### finished. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I never touched ###CHAR34### !'' 
###CHAR68### said loudly, uncomfortably aware of everyone looking at ###CHAR68###, including all the ###CHAR52### on the walls. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``And I don't even know what a Squib is.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Rubbish!'' 
snarled Filch. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR34### saw my Kwikspell letter!'' 
###DIALOGUE###``If I might speak, Headmaster,'' said ###CHAR63### from the shadows, and ###CHAR68###'s sense of forboding increased; ###CHAR68### was sure nothing ###CHAR63### had to say was going to do ###CHAR63### any good. 
###DIALOGUE###``###CHAR54### and ###CHAR54###'s friends may have simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time,'' ###CHAR63### said, a slight sneer curling ###CHAR63###'s mouth as though ###CHAR63### doubted it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But we do have a set of suspicious circumstances here. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Why was ###CHAR54### in the upstairs corridor at all? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Why wasn't ###CHAR54### at the Halloween feast?'' 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR68###, ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### all launched into an explanation about the deathday party. ''
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###... there were hundreds of ghosts, theyll tell you we were there -'' ``But why not join the feast afterward?'' 
said ###CHAR63###, ###CHAR63###'s black eyes glittering in the candlelight. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Why go up to that corridor?'' 
###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### looked at Harry. 
###DIALOGUE###``Because - because -'' ###CHAR68### said, ###CHAR68###'s heart thumping very fast; something told ###CHAR68### it would sound very far-fetched if ###CHAR68### told them ###CHAR68### had been led there by a bodiless voice no one but ###CHAR68### could hear, ``because we were tired and wanted to go to bed,'' ###CHAR68### said. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Without any supper?'' 
said ###CHAR63###, a triumphant smile flickering across ###CHAR63###'s gaunt face. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I didn't think ghosts provided food fit for living people at their parties.'' 
###DIALOGUE###``We weren't hungry,'' said ###CHAR68### loudly as ###CHAR68###'s stomach gave a huge rumble. 
###CHAR63###'s nasty smile widened. 
###DIALOGUE###``I suggest, Headmaster, that ###CHAR54### is not being entirely truthful,'' ###CHAR63### said. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It might be a good idea if ###CHAR54### were deprived of certain privileges until ###CHAR54### is ready to tell us the whole story. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I personally feel ###CHAR54### should be taken off the Gryffindor Quidditch team until ###CHAR54### is ready to be honest.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Really, ###CHAR63###,'' said Professor ###CHAR96### sharply, ``I see no reason to stop the boy playing Quidditch. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###This cat wasn't hit over the head with a broomstick. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There is no evidence at all that ###CHAR54### has done anything wrong.'' 
###CHAR94### was giving ###CHAR68### a searching look. 
###CHAR68###'s twinkling lightblue gaze made ###CHAR68### feel as though ###CHAR68### were being X-rayed. 
###DIALOGUE###``Innocent until proven guilty, ###CHAR63###,'' ###CHAR68### said firmly. 
###CHAR63### looked furious. 
So did Filch. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``My cat has been Petrified!'' 
###CHAR68### shrieked, ###CHAR68###'s eyes popping. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I want to see some punishment!'' 
###DIALOGUE###``We will be able to cure her, Argus,'' said ###CHAR94### patiently. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Professer Sprout recently managed to procure some Mandrakes. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###As soon as they have reached their full size, I will have a potion made that will revive ###CHAR34### .'' 
###DIALOGUE###``I'll make it,'' ###CHAR73### butted in. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I must have done it a hundred times. 
###DIALOGUE###I could whip up a Mandrake Restorative Draught in my sleep -'' ``Excuse me,'' said ###CHAR63### icily. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But I believe I am the Potions master at this school.'' 
There was a very awkward pause. 
###DIALOGUE###``You may go,'' ###CHAR94### said to ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR68###, and ###CHAR25###. 
They went, as quickly as they could without actually running. 
When they were a floor up from ###CHAR73###'s office, they turned into an empty classroom and closed the door quietly behind them. 
###CHAR68### squinted at ###CHAR68###'s friends' darkened faces. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``D'you think I should have told them about that voice I heard?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``No,'' said ###CHAR68###, without hesitation. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Hearing voices no one else can hear isn't a good sign, even in the wizarding world.'' 
###DIALOGUE###Something in ###CHAR68###'s voice made ###CHAR68### ask, ``You do believe me, don't you?'' ''
###DIALOGUE###`Course I do,'' said ###CHAR68### quickly. 
###DIALOGUE###``But -you must admit it's weird ...'' ``I know it's weird,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``The whole thing's weird. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###What was that writing on the wall about? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The Cbamber Has Been Opened... What's that supposed to mean?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``You know, it rings a sort of bell,'' said ###CHAR68### slowly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I think someone told me a story about a secret chamber at ###CHAR26### once ... might've been Bill ...'' ``And what on earth's a Squib?'' 
said ###CHAR68###. 
To ###CHAR68###'s surprise, ###CHAR68### stifled a snigger. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Well - it's not funny really - but as it's Filch, ###CHAR26### said. 
###DIALOGUE###``A Squib is someone who was born into a wizarding family but hasn't got any magic powers. 
Kind of the opposite of Muggle-born wizards, but Squibs are quite unusual. 
If Filch's trying to learn magic from a Kwikspell course, I reckon ###CHAR26### must be a Squib. 
It would explain a lot. 
###DIALOGUE###Like why ###CHAR26### hates students so much.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### gave a satisfied smile. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR26###'s bitter.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###A clock chimed somewhere. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Midnight,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We'd better get to bed before ###CHAR63### comes along and tries to frame us for something else.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###For a few days, the school could talk of little else but the attack on ###CHAR34### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Filch kept it fresh in everyone's minds by pacing the spot where ###CHAR34### had been attacked, as though ###CHAR68### thought the attacker might come back. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### had seen ###CHAR68### scrubbing the message on the wall with Mrs. Skower's All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover, but to no effect; the words still gleamed as brightly as ever on the stone. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###When Filch wasn't guarding the scene of the crime, ###CHAR68### was skulking redeyed through the corridors, lunging out at unsuspecting students and trying to put them in detention for things like ``breathing loudly' and ``looking happy.'' 
###CHAR76### seemed very disturbed by ###CHAR34### 's fate. 
According to ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR76### was a great cat lover. 
###DIALOGUE###``But you haven't really got to know ###CHAR34### ,'' ###CHAR68### told ###CHAR76###'s bracingly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Honestly, we're much better off without ###CHAR34###.'' 
###CHAR76###'s lip trembled. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Stuff like this doesn't often happen at Hogwarts,'' ###CHAR68### assured ###CHAR76###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``They'll catch the maniac who did it and have him out of here in no time. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I just hope he's got time to Petrify Filch before he's expelled. 
###DIALOGUE###I'm only joking -'' ###CHAR68### added hastily as ###CHAR76### blanched. 
The attack had also had an effect on ###CHAR25###. 
It was quite usual for ###CHAR25### to spend a lot of time reading, but ###CHAR25### was now doing almost nothing else. 
Nor could ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### get much response from ###CHAR25###'s when they asked what ###CHAR25### was up to, and not until the following Wednesday did they find out. 
###CHAR68### had been held back in Potions, where ###CHAR63### had made ###CHAR63### stay behind to scrape tubeworms off the desks. 
After a hurried lunch, ###CHAR63### went upstairs to meet ###CHAR68### in the library, and saw ###CHAR12### - ###CHAR38###, the ###CHAR80### boy from Herbology, coming toward ###CHAR68###. 
###CHAR68### had just opened ###CHAR68###'s mouth to say hello when ###CHAR100### caught sight of ###CHAR100###, turned abruptly, and sped off in the opposite direction. 
###CHAR68### found ###CHAR68### at the back of the library, measuring ###CHAR68###'s History of Magic homework. 
###DIALOGUE###Professor ###CHAR56### had asked for a threefoot-long composition on ``The Medieval Assembly of European Wizards.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I don't believe it, I'm still eight inches short said ###CHAR68### fu riously, letting go of ###CHAR68###'s parchment, which sprang back into a roll. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``And ###CHAR25###'s done four feet seven inches and ###CHAR25###'s writing's tiny. '' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Where is ###CHAR25###?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###asked ###CHAR68###, grabbing the tape measure and unrolling ###CHAR68###'s own homework. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Somewhere over there,'' said ###CHAR68###, pointing along the shelves. 
###DIALOGUE###``Looking for another book. 
###DIALOGUE###I think ###CHAR25###'s trying to read the whole library before Christmas.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### told ###CHAR68### about ###CHAR100### running away from ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``Dunno why you care. 
###DIALOGUE###I thought ###CHAR68### was a bit of an idiot,'' said ###CHAR68###, scribbling away, making ###CHAR68###'s writing as large as possible. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``All that junk about ###CHAR73### being so great -'' ###CHAR25### emerged from between the bookshelves. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR25### looked irritable and at last seemed ready to talk to them. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``All the copies of Hogwarts, A History have been taken out,'' ###CHAR25### said, sitting down next to ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``And there's a two-week waiting list. 
###DIALOGUE###I wish I hadn't left my copy at home, but I couldn't fit it in my trunk with all the ###CHAR73### books.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Why do you want it?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``The same reason everyone else wants it,'' said ###CHAR25###, ``to read up on the legend of the Chamber of Secrets.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What's that?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68### quickly. 
###DIALOGUE###``That's just it. 
###DIALOGUE###I can't remember,'' said ###CHAR25###, biting ###CHAR25###'s lip. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``And I can't find the story anywhere else -'' ``###CHAR25###, let me read your composition,'' said ###CHAR68### desperately, checking ###CHAR68###'s watch. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``No, I won't,'' said ###CHAR25###, suddenly severe. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You've had ten days to finish it -'' ``I only need another two inches, come on -'' The bell rang. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### led the way to History of Magic, bickering. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###History of Magic was the dullest subject on their schedule. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Professor ###CHAR56###, who taught it, was their only ghost teacher, and the most exciting thing that ever happened in ###CHAR56###'s classes was ###CHAR56###'s entering the room through the blackboard. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Ancient and shriveled, many people said ###CHAR56### hadn't noticed ###CHAR56### was dead. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR56### had simply got up to teach one day and left ###CHAR56###'s body behind ###CHAR56### in an armchair in front of the staff room fire; ###CHAR56###'s routine had not varied in the slightest since. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Today was as boring as ever. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Professor ###CHAR56### opened ###CHAR56###'s notes and began to read in a flat drone like an old vacuum cleaner until nearly everyone in the class was in a deep stupor, occasionally coming to long enough to copy down a name or date, then falling asleep again. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR56### had been speaking for half an hour when something happened that had never happened before. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR25### put up ###CHAR25###'s hand. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Professor ###CHAR56###, glancing up in the middle of a deadly dull lec ture on the International Warlock Convention of 1289, looked amazed. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Miss - er -?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``###CHAR25###, Professor. 
###DIALOGUE###I was wondering if you could tell us anything about the Chamber of Secrets,'' said ###CHAR25### in a clear voice. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR28### , who had been sitting with ###CHAR28###'s mouth hanging open, gazing out of the window, jerked out of ###CHAR28###'s trance; Lavender Brown's head came up off ###CHAR25###'s arms and ###CHAR92### 's elbow slipped off ###CHAR92###'s desk. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Professor ###CHAR56### blinked. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``My subject is History of Magic,'' ###CHAR56### said in ###CHAR56###'s dry, wheezy voice. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I deal with facts, ###CHAR25### , not myths and legends.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR56### cleared ###CHAR56###'s throat with a small noise like chalk s!
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###-ping and continued, ``In September of that year, a subcommittee of Sardinian sorcerers '' ###CHAR56### stuttered to a halt. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR25###'s hand was waving in the air again. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Miss Grant?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Please, sir, don't legends always have a basis in fact?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Professor ###CHAR56### was looking at ###CHAR25###'s in such amazement, ###CHAR68### was sure no student had ever interrupted ###CHAR68### before, alive or dead. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Well,'' said Professor ###CHAR56### slowly, ``yes, one could argue that, I suppose.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR56### peered at ###CHAR25### as though ###CHAR56### had never seen a student properly before. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``However, the legend of which you speak is such a very sensational, even ludicrous tale -'' But the whole class was now hanging on Professor ###CHAR56###'s every word. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###He looked dimly at them all, every face turned to his. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### could tell ###CHAR68### was completely thrown by such an unusual show of interest. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Oh, very well,'' ###CHAR68### said slowly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Let me see ... the Chamber of Secrets ... ``You all know, of course, that ###CHAR26### was founded over a thousand years ago - the precise date is uncertain - by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The four school Houses are named after them: ###CHAR99### , Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and ###CHAR45### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They built this castle together, far from prying Muggle eyes, for it was an age when magic was feared by common people, and witches and wizards suffered much persecution.'' 
###CHAR68### paused, gazed blearily around the room, and continued. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``For a few years, the founders worked in harmony together, seeking out youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to the castle to be educated. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###But then disagreements sprang up between them. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###A rift began to grow between Slytherin and the others. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR45### wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR45### believed that magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR45### disliked taking students of Muggle parentage, believing them to be untrustworthy. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###After a while, there was a serious argument on the subject between Slytherin and Gryffindor, and ###CHAR45### left the school.'' 
Professor ###CHAR56### paused again, pursing ###CHAR56###'s lips, looking like a wrinkled old tortoise. 
###DIALOGUE###``Reliable historical sources tell us this much,'' ###CHAR56### said. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But these honest facts have been obscured by the fanciful legend of the Chamber of Secrets. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The story goes that ###CHAR45### had built a hidden chamber in the castle, of which the other founders knew nothing. 
###DIALOGUE###``Slytherin, according to the legend, sealed the Chamber of Secrets so that none would be able to open it until ###CHAR45###'s own true heir arrived at the school. 
###DIALOGUE###The heir alone would be able to unseal the Chamber of Secrets, unleash the horror within, and use it to purge the school of all who were unworthy to study magic.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There was silence as ###CHAR56### finished telling the story, but it wasn't the usual, sleepy silence that filled Professor ###CHAR56###'s classes. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There was unease in the air as everyone continued to watch ###CHAR56###, hoping for more. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Professor ###CHAR56### looked faintly annoyed. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``The whole thing is arrant nonsense, of course,'' ###CHAR56### said. 
###DIALOGUE###``Naturally, the school has been searched for evidence of such a chamber, many times, by the most learned witches and wizards. 
It does not exist. 
###DIALOGUE###A tale told to frighten the gullible.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR25###'s hand was back in the air. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Sir - what exactly do you mean by the `horror within' the Chamber?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``That is believed to be some sort of monster, which the Heir of Slytherin alone can control,'' said Professor ###CHAR56### in ###CHAR56###'s dry, reedy voice. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The class exchanged nervous looks. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I tell you, the thing does not exist,'' said Professor ###CHAR56###, shuffling ###CHAR56###'s notes. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``There is no Chamber and no monster.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But, sir,'' said ###CHAR4### , ``if the Chamber can only be opened by ###CHAR45###'s true heir, no one else would be able to find it, would they?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Nonsense, O'Flaherty,'' said Professor ###CHAR56### in an aggravated tone. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``If a long succession of ###CHAR26### headmasters and headmistresses haven't found the thing -'' ``But, Professor,'' piped up Parvati Patil, ``you'd probably have to use Dark Magic to open it -'' ``Just because a wizard doesn't use Dark Magic doesn't mean he can't, Miss Pennyfeather,'' snapped Professor ###CHAR56###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I repeat, if the likes of ###CHAR94### -'' ``But maybe you've got to be related to Slytherin, so ###CHAR94### couldn't -'' began ###CHAR28### , but Professor ###CHAR56### had had enough. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``That will do,'' ###CHAR56### said sharply. 
###DIALOGUE###``It is a myth! 
It does not exist! 
There is not a shred of evidence that ###CHAR45### ever built so much as a secret broom cupboard! 
I regret telling you such a foolish story! 
###DIALOGUE###We will return, if you please, to history, to solid, believable, verifiable fact!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###And within five minutes, the class had sunk back into its usual torpor. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I always knew ###CHAR45### was a twisted old loony,'' ###CHAR68### told ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### as they fought their way through the teeming corridors at the end of the lesson to drop off their bags before dinner. 
###DIALOGUE###``But I never knew ###CHAR45### started all this pure-blood stuff. 
I wouldn't be in ###CHAR45###'s house if you paid me. 
###DIALOGUE###Honestly, if the Sorting Hat had tried to put me in Slytherin, I'd've got the train straight back home ...'' ###CHAR25### nodded fervently, but ###CHAR68### didn't say anything. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###'s stomach had just dropped unpleasantly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### had never told ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### that the Sorting Hat had seriously considered putting ###CHAR68### in Slytherin. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### could remember, as though it were yesterday, the small voice that had spoken in ###CHAR68###'s ear when ###CHAR68###'d placed the hat on ###CHAR68###'s head a year before: You could be great, you know, it's all here in your head, and ###CHAR45### would help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that... But ###CHAR68###, who had already heard of ###CHAR47### 's reputa tion for turning out Dark wizards, had thought desperately, Not Slytherin! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###and the hat had said, Oh, well, if you're sure ... better be Gryffindor... As they were shunted along in the throng, Colin Creevy went past. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Hiya, ###CHAR68###!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Hullo, ###CHAR66###,'' said ###CHAR68### automatically. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Harry - ###CHAR68### - a boy in my class has been saying you're But ###CHAR66### was so small ###CHAR66### couldn~t fight against the tide of people bearing ###CHAR66### toward the Great Hall; they heard him squeak, ``See you, ###CHAR68###!'' 
and ###CHAR68### was gone. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What's a boy in ###CHAR68###'s class saying about you?'' 
###CHAR25### wondered. 
###DIALOGUE###``That I'm ###CHAR45###'s heir, I expect,'' said ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR68###'s stomach dropping another inch or so as ###CHAR68### suddenly remembered the way ###CHAR12### - ###CHAR38### had run away from ###CHAR68### at lunchtime. 
###DIALOGUE###``People here'll believe anything,'' said ###CHAR68### in disgust. 
The crowd thinned and they were able to climb the next staircase without difficulty. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``D'you really think there's a Chamber of Secrets?'' 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR68### asked ###CHAR25###. 
###DIALOGUE###``I don't know,'' ###CHAR25### said, frowning. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR94### couldn't cure ###CHAR34### , and that makes me think that whatever attacked ###CHAR34### might not be - well - human.'' 
As ###CHAR25### spoke, they turned a corner and found themselves at the end of the very corridor where the attack had happened. 
They stopped and looked. 
###DIALOGUE###The scene was just as it had been that night, except that there was no stiff cat hanging from the torch bracket, and an empty chair stood against the wall bearing the message ``The Chamber of Secrets has been Opened.'' 
###DIALOGUE###``That's where Filch has been keeping guard,'' ###CHAR68### muttered. 
They looked at each other. 
The corridor was deserted. 
###DIALOGUE###``Can't hurt to have a poke around,'' said ###CHAR68###, dropping ###CHAR68###'s bag and getting to ###CHAR68###'s hands and knees so that ###CHAR68### could crawl along, searching for clues. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Scorch marks!'' 
###CHAR68### said. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Here - and here -'' ``Come and look at this!'' 
said ###CHAR25###. 
###DIALOGUE###``This is funny ...'' ###CHAR68### got up and crossed to the window next to the message on the wall. 
###CHAR25### was pointing at the topmost pane, where around twenty spiders were scuttling, apparently fighting to get through a small crack. 
A long, silvery thread was dangling like a rope, as though they had all climbed it in their hurry to get outside. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Have you ever seen spiders act like that?'' 
said ###CHAR25### wonderingly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``No,'' said ###CHAR68###, ``have you, ###CHAR68###? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###?'' 
###CHAR68### looked over ###CHAR68###'s shoulder. 
###CHAR68### was standing well back and seemed to be fighting the impulse to run. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What's up?'' 
said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``I - don't - like - spiders,'' said ###CHAR68### tensely. 
###DIALOGUE###``I never knew that,'' said ###CHAR25###, looking at ###CHAR68### in surprise. 
###DIALOGUE###``You've used spiders in Potions loads of times ...'' ``I don't mind them dead,'' said ###CHAR68###, who was carefully looking anywhere but at the window. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I just don't like the way they move ... ###CHAR25### giggled. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It's not funny,'' said ###CHAR68###, fiercely. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``If you must know, when I was three, ###CHAR55### turned my - my teddy bear into a great big fiIthy spider because I broke ###CHAR55###'s toy broomstick ... You wouldn't like them either if you'd been holding your bear and suddenly it had too many legs and... '' ###CHAR68### broke off, shuddering. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR25### was obviously still trying not to laugh. 
###DIALOGUE###Feeling they had better get off the subject, ###CHAR68### said, ``Remember all that water on the floor? 
Where did that come from? 
###DIALOGUE###Someone's mopped it up.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It was about here,'' said ###CHAR68###, recovering himself to walk a few paces past Filch's chair and pointing. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Level with this door.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### reached for the brass doorknob but suddenly withdrew ###CHAR68###'s hand as though ###CHAR68###'d been burned. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What's the matter?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Can't go in there,'' said ###CHAR68### gruffly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``That's a girls' toilet.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Oh, ###CHAR68###, there won't be anyone in there,'' said ###CHAR25###, standing up and coming over. 
###DIALOGUE###``That's Moaning Myrtle's place. 
###DIALOGUE###Come on, let's have a look.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###And ignoring the large OUT of ORDER sign, ###CHAR25### opened the door. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It was the gloomiest, most depressing bathroom ###CHAR68### had ever set foot in. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Under a large, cracked, and spotted mirror were a row of chipped sinks. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The floor was damp and reflected the dull light given off by the stubs of a few candles, burning low in their holders; the wooden doors to the stalls were flaking and scratched and one of them was dangling off its hinges. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR25### put ###CHAR25###'s fingers to ###CHAR25###'s lips and set off toward the end stall. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###When ###CHAR25### reached it ###CHAR25### said, ``Hello, Myrtle, how are you?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### went to look. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Moaning Myrtle was floating above the tank of the toilet, picking a spot on her chin. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``This is a girls' bathroom,'' she said, eyeing ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### suspiciously. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``They're not girls.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``No,'' ###CHAR25### agreed. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I just wanted to show them how er - nice it is in here.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR25### waved vaguely at the dirty old mirror and the damp floor. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Ask her if she saw anything,'' ###CHAR68### mouthed at Hermione. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What are you whispering?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said Myrtle, staring at ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Nothing,'' said ###CHAR68### quickly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We wanted to ask -'' ``I wish people would stop talking behind my back!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said Myrtle, in a voice choked with tears. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I do have feelings, you know, even if I am dead -'' ``Myrtle, no one wants to upset you,'' said ###CHAR25###. 
###DIALOGUE###``Harry only -'' ``No one wants to upset me! 
###DIALOGUE###That's a good one!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###howled Myrtle. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``My life was nothing but misery at this place and now people come along ruining my death!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We wanted to ask you if you've seen anything funny lately,'' said ###CHAR25### quickly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Because a cat was attacked right outside your front door on Halloween.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Did you see anyone near here that night?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I wasn't paying attention,'' said Myrtle dramatically. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Peeves upset me so much I came in here and tried to kill myself Then, of course, I remembered that I'm - that I'm '' ``Already dead,'' said ###CHAR68### helpfully. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Myrtle gave a tragic sob, rose up in the air, turned over, and dived headfirst into the toilet, splashing water all over them and vanishing from sight, although from the direction of her muffled sobs, she had come to rest somewhere in the U-bend. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### stood with their mouths open, but ###CHAR25### shrugged wearily and said, ``Honestly, that was almost cheerful for Myrtle ... Come on, let's go.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### had barely closed the door on Myrtle's gurgling sobs when a loud voice made all three of them jump. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``RON!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR70### had stopped dead at the head of the stairs, prefect badge agleam, an expression of complete shock on ###CHAR70###'s face. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``That's a girls' bathroom!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR70### gasped. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What were you -?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Just having a look around,'' ###CHAR68### shrugged. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Clues, you know -'' ###CHAR70### swelled in a manner that reminded ###CHAR68### forcefully of ###CHAR83### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Get - away - from - there -'' Perry said, striding toward them and starting to bustle them along, flapping his arms. 
###DIALOGUE###``Don't you care what this looks like? 
###DIALOGUE###Coming back here while everyone's at dinner -'' ``Why shouldn't we be here?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68### hotly, stopping short and glaring at Percy. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Listen, we never laid a finger on that cat!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``That's what I told ###CHAR76###,'' said ###CHAR70### fiercely, ``but ###CHAR76### still seems to think you're going to be expelled, I've never seen ###CHAR76###'s so upset, crying ###CHAR76###'s eyes out, you might think of ###CHAR76###, all the first years are thoroughly overexcited by this business -'' ``You don't care about ###CHAR76###,'' said ###CHAR68###, whose ears were now reddening. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You're just worried I'm going to mess up your chances of being Head Boy -'' ``Five points from Gryffindor!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR70### said tersely, fingering ###CHAR70###'s prefect badge. 
###DIALOGUE###``And I hope it teaches you a lesson! 
###DIALOGUE###No more detective work, or I'll write to Mum!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###And ###CHAR70### strode off, the back of ###CHAR70###'s neck as red as ###CHAR68###'s ears. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###, ###CHAR68###, and ###CHAR25### chose seats as far as possible from ###CHAR70### in the common room that night. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### was still in a very bad temper and kept blotting ###CHAR68###'s Charms homework. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###When ###CHAR68### reached absently for ###CHAR68###'s wand to remove the smudges, it ignited the parchment. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Fuming almost as much as ###CHAR68###'s homework, ###CHAR68### slammed The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 shut. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###To ###CHAR68###'s surprise, ###CHAR25### followed suit. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Who can it be, though?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR25### said in a quiet voice, as though continuing a conversation they had just been having. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Who'd want to frighten all the Squibs and Muggle-borns out of Hogwarts?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Let's think,'' said ###CHAR68### in mock puzzlement. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Who do we know who thinks Muggle-borns are scum?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### looked at ###CHAR25###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR25### looked back, unconvinced. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``If you're talking about ###CHAR50### -'' ``Of course I am!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You heard ###CHAR50### - `You'll be next, Mudbloods!'
###DIALOGUE###- come on, you've only got to look at ###CHAR50###'s foul rat face to know it's ###CHAR50### -'' ``Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR25### skeptically. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Look at his family,'' said ###CHAR68###, closing ###CHAR68###'s books, too. 
###DIALOGUE###``The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin; he's always boasting about it. 
They could easily be ###CHAR45###'s descendants. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR45###'s father's definitely evil enough.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``They couldve had the key to the Chamber of Secrets for centuries!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Handing it down, father to son ...'' ``Well,'' said ###CHAR25### cautiously, ``I suppose it's possible ...'' ``But how do we prove it?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68### darkly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``There might be a way,'' said ###CHAR25### slowly, dropping ###CHAR25###'s voice still further with a quick glance across the room at Percy. 
###DIALOGUE###``Of course, it would be difficult. 
And dangerous, very dangerous. 
###DIALOGUE###We'd be breaking about fifty school rules, I expect -'' ``If, in a month or so, you feel like explaining, you will let us know, won't you?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68### irritably. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``All right,'' said ###CHAR25### coldly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What we'd need to do is to get inside the Slytherin common room and ask ###CHAR50### a few questions without ###CHAR50### realizing it's us.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But that's impossible,'' ###CHAR68### said as ###CHAR68### laughed. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``No, it's not,'' said ###CHAR25###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``All we'd need would be some Polyjuice Potion.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What's that?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### together. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR63### mentioned it in class a few weeks ago -'' ``D'you think we've got nothing better to do in Potions than listen to ###CHAR63###?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###muttered ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``It transforms you into somebody else. 
Think about it! 
We could change into three of the Slytherins. 
No one would know it was us. 
###CHAR50### would probably tell us anything. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR50###'s probably boasting about it in the Slytherin common room right now, if only we could hear ###CHAR50###.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``This Polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me,'' said ###CHAR68###, frowning. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What if we were stuck looking like three of the Slytherins forever?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It wears off after a while,'' said ###CHAR25###, waving ###CHAR25###'s hand impatiently. 
###DIALOGUE###``But getting hold of the recipe will be very difficult. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR63### said it was in a book called ###CHAR77### and it's bound to be in the Restricted Section of the library.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There was only one way to get out a book from the Restricted Section: You needed a signed note of permission from a teacher. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Hard to see why we'd want the book, really,'' said ###CHAR68###, ``if we weren't going to try and make one of the potions.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I think,'' said ###CHAR25###, ``that if we made it sound as though we were just interested in the theory, we might stand a chance ...'' ``Oh, come on, no teacher's going to fall for that,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``They'd have to be really thick ...''
THE ROGUE BLUDGER
Since the disastrous episode of the pixies, Professor ###CHAR73### had not brought live creatures to class. 
Instead, ###CHAR73### read passages from ###CHAR73###'s books to them, and sometimes reenacted some of the more dramatic bits. 
###CHAR73### usually picked ###CHAR68### to help ###CHAR73### with these reconstructions; so far, ###CHAR68### had been forced to play a simple Transylvanian villager whom ###CHAR73### had cured of a Babbling Curse, a yeti with a head cold, and a vampire who had been unable to eat anything except lettuce since ###CHAR73### had dealt with ###CHAR73###. 
###CHAR68### was hauled to the front of the class during their very next Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson, this time acting a werewolf If ###CHAR68### hadn't had a very good reason for keeping ###CHAR73### in a good mood, ###CHAR73### would have refused to do it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Nice loud howl, ###CHAR68### - exactly - and then, if you'll believe it, I pounced - like this - slammed ###CHAR68### to the floor - thus with one hand, I managed to hold ###CHAR68### down - with my other, I put my wand to ###CHAR68###'s throat -I then screwed up my remaining strength and performed the immensely complex Homorphus Charm - ###CHAR68### let out a piteous moan - go on, ###CHAR68### - higher than that - good - the fur vanished - the fangs shrank - and ###CHAR68### turned back into a man. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Simple, yet effective - and another village will remember me forever as the hero who delivered them from the monthly terror of werewolf attacks.'' 
The bell rang and ###CHAR73### got to ###CHAR73###'s feet. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Homework - compose a poem about my defeat of the Wagga Wagga Werewolf! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Signed copies of Magical Me to the author of the best one!'' 
The class began to leave. 
###CHAR68### returned to the back of the room, where ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### were waiting. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Ready?'' 
###CHAR68### muttered. 
###DIALOGUE###``Wait till everyone's gone,'' said ###CHAR25### nervously. 
###DIALOGUE###``All right ... '' ###CHAR25### approached ###CHAR73###'s desk, a piece of paper clutched tightly in ###CHAR25###'s hand, ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### right behind ###CHAR25###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Er - Professor ###CHAR73###?'' 
###CHAR25### stammered. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I wanted to - to get this book out of the library. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Just for background reading.'' 
###CHAR25### held out the piece of paper, ###CHAR25###'s hand shaking slightly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But the thing is, it's in the Restricted Section of the library, so I need a teacher to sign for it - I'm sure it would help me understand what you say in Gadding with Ghouls about slow-acting venoms ``Ah, Gadding with Ghouls!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR73###, taking the note from ###CHAR25### and smiling widely at ###CHAR25###. 
###DIALOGUE###``Possibly my very favorite book. 
###DIALOGUE###You enjoyed it?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Oh, yes,'' said ###CHAR25### eagerly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``So clever, the way you trapped that last one with the tea-strainer -'' ``Well, I'm sure no one will mind me giving the best student of the year a little extra help,'' said ###CHAR73### warmly, and ###CHAR73### pulled out an enormous peacock quill. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Yes, nice, isn't it?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR73### said, misreading the revolted look on ###CHAR68###'s face. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I usually save it for book-signings.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### scrawled an enormous loopy signature on the note and handed it back to ###CHAR25###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``So, ###CHAR68###,'' said ###CHAR73###, while ###CHAR25### folded the note with fumbling fingers and slipped it into ###CHAR25###'s bag. 
###DIALOGUE###``Tomorrow's the first Quidditch match of the season, I believe? 
Gryffindor against ###CHAR45###, is it not? 
I hear you're a useful player. 
I was a Seeker, too. 
I was asked to try for the National Squad, but preferred to dedicate my life to the eradication of the Dark Forces. 
Still, if ever you feel the need for a little private training, don't hesitate to ask. 
###DIALOGUE###Always happy to pass on my expertise to less able players ...'' ###CHAR68### made an indistinct noise in ###CHAR68###'s throat and then hurried off after ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I don't believe it,'' ###CHAR68### said as the three of them examined the signature on the note. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``He didn't even look at the book we wanted.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``That's because he's a brainless git,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But who cares, we've got what we needed -'' ``He is not a brainless git,'' said ###CHAR25### shrilly as they half ran toward the library. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Just because he said you were the best student of the year -'' They dropped their voices as they entered the muffled stillness of the library. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR16### , the librarian, was a thin, irritable woman who looked like an underfed vulture. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Moste Potente Potions?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR16### repeated suspiciously, trying to take the note from Hermione; but ###CHAR25### wouldn't let go. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I was wondering if I could keep it,'' ###CHAR25### said breathlessly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Oh, come on,'' said ###CHAR68###, wrenching it from ###CHAR25###'s grasp and thrusting it at Madam Pince. 
###DIALOGUE###``We'll get you another autograph. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR73###'ll sign anything if it stands still long enough.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Madam Pince held the note up to the light, as though determined to detect a forgery, but it passed the test. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR25### stalked away between the lofty shelves and returned several minutes later carrying a large and moldy-looking book. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR25### put it carefully into ###CHAR25###'s bag and they left, trying not to walk too quickly or look too guilty. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Five minutes later, they were barricaded in Moaning Myrtle's out-oforder bathroom once again. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR25### had overridden ###CHAR68###'s objections by pointing out that it was the last place anyone in their right minds would go, so they were guaranteed some privacy. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Moaning ###CHAR20### was crying noisily in ###CHAR20###'s stall, but they were ignoring ###CHAR20###, and ###CHAR20### them. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR25### opened ###CHAR77### carefully, and the three of them bent over the damp-spotted pages. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It was clear from a glance why it belonged in the Restricted Section. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Some of the potions had effects almost too gruesome to think about, and there were some very unpleasant illustrations, which included a man who seemed to have been turned inside out and a witch sprouting several extra pairs of arms out of her head. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Here it is,'' said ###CHAR25### excitedly as ###CHAR25### found the page headed The Polyjuice Potion. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It was decorated with drawings of people halfway through transforming into other people. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Harry sin cerely hoped the artist had imagined the looks of intense pain on their faces. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``This is the most complicated potion I've ever seen,'' said ###CHAR25### as they scanned the recipe. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Lacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed, and knotgrass,'' ###CHAR25### murmured, running ###CHAR25###'s finger down the list of ingredients. 
###DIALOGUE###``Well, they're easy enough, they're in the student storecupboard, we can help ourselves ... Oooh, look, powdered horn of a bicorn - don't know where we're going to get that - shredded skin of a boomslang -. 
###DIALOGUE###that'll be tricky, too and of course a bit of whoever we want to change into.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Excuse me?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68### sharply. 
###DIALOGUE###``What d'you mean, a bit of whoever we're changing into? 
###DIALOGUE###I'm drinking nothing with ###CHAR44###'s toenails in it -'' ###CHAR25### continued as though ###CHAR25### hadn't heard ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We don't have to worry about that yet, though, because we add those bits last ...'' ###CHAR68### turned, speechless, to ###CHAR68###, who had another worry. 
###DIALOGUE###``D'you realize how much we're going to have to steal, ###CHAR25###? 
Shredded skin of a boomslang, that's definitely not in the students' cupboard. 
What're we going to do, break into ###CHAR63###'s private stores? 
###DIALOGUE###I don't know if this is a good idea ...'' ###CHAR25### shut the book with a snap. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Well, if you two are going to chicken out, fine,'' ###CHAR25### said. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There were bright pink patches on ###CHAR25###'s cheeks and ###CHAR25###'s eyes were brighter than usual. 
###DIALOGUE###``I don't want to break rules, you know. 
I think threatening Muggle-borns is far worse than brewing up a difficult potion. 
But if you don't want to find out if it's ###CHAR50###, I'll go straight to Madam Pince now and hand the book back in =' ``I never thought Id see the day when you'd be persuading us to break rules,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``All right, we'll do it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###But not toenails, okay?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``How long will it take to make, anyway?'' 
said ###CHAR68### as ###CHAR25###, looking happier, opened the book again. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Well, since the fluxweed has got to be picked at the full moon and the lacewings have got to be stewed for twenty-one days ... I'd say it'd be ready in about a month, if we can get all the ingredients.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``A month?'' 
said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Malfoy could have attacked half the Muggleborns in the school by then!'' 
###DIALOGUE###But ###CHAR25###'s eyes narrowed dangerously again, and ###CHAR68### added swiftly, ``But it's the best plan we've got, so full steam ahead, I say.'' 
###DIALOGUE###However, while ###CHAR25### was checking that the coast was clear for them to leave the bathroom, ###CHAR68### muttered to ###CHAR68###, ``It'll be a lot less hassle if you can just knock ###CHAR50### off ###CHAR50###'s broom tomorrow. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### woke early on Saturday morning and lay for a while thinking about the coming Quidditch match. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### was nervous, mainly at the thought of what ###CHAR43### would say if Gryffindor lost, but also at the idea of facing a team mounted on the fastest racing brooms gold could buy. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR43### had never wanted to beat ###CHAR45### so badly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###After half an hour of lying there with ###CHAR43###'s insides churning, ###CHAR43### got up, dressed, and went down to breakfast early, where ###CHAR43### found the rest of the Gryffindor team huddled at the long, empty table, all looking uptight and not speaking much. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###As eleven o'clock approached, the whole school started to make its way down to the Quidditch stadium. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It was a muggy sort of day with a hint of thunder in the air. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### came hurrying over to wish ###CHAR68### good luck as ###CHAR68### entered the locker rooms. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The team pulled on their scarlet Gryffindor robes, then sat down to listen to ###CHAR43###'s usual pre-match pep talk. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Slytherin has better brooms than us,'' ###CHAR68### began. 
###DIALOGUE###``No point denying it. 
But we've got better people on our brooms. 
###DIALOGUE###We've trained harder than they have, we've been flying in all weathers -'' -LRB-``Too true,'' muttered ###CHAR19### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I haven't been properly dry since August''-RRB- ''- and we're going to make them rue the day they let that little bit of slime, ###CHAR50###, buy ###CHAR50###'s way onto their team.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Chest heaving with emotion, ###CHAR43### turned to ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``It'll be down to you, ###CHAR68###, to show them that a Seeker has to have something more than a rich father. 
###DIALOGUE###Get to that Snitch before ###CHAR50### or die trying, ###CHAR68###, because we've got to win today, we've got to.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``So no pressure, Harry'' said ###CHAR55###, winking at ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###As they walked out onto the pitch, a roar of noise greeted them; mainly cheers, because Ravenclaw and ###CHAR80### were anxious to see ###CHAR45### beaten, but the Slytherins in the crowd made their boos and hisses heard, too. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR85### , the Quidditch teacher, asked Flint and ###CHAR43### to shake hands, which they did, giving each other threatening stares and gripping rather harder than was necessary. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``On my whistle,'' said ###CHAR85### . 
###DIALOGUE###``Three ... two ... one... With a roar from the crowd to speed them upward, the fourteen players rose toward the leaden sky. 
###CHAR68### flew higher than any of them, squinting around for the Snitch. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``All right there, Scarhead?'' 
yelled ###CHAR50###, shooting underneath ###CHAR50### as though to show off the speed of ###CHAR50###'s broom. 
###CHAR68### had no time to reply. 
At that very moment, a heavy black Bludger came pelting toward ###CHAR68###; ###CHAR68### avoided it so narrowly that ###CHAR68### felt it ruffle ###CHAR68###'s hair as it passed. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Close one, ###CHAR68###!'' 
said ###CHAR19###, streaking past ###CHAR19### with ###CHAR19###'s club in ###CHAR19###'s hand, ready to knock the Bludger back toward a Slytherin. 
###CHAR68### saw ###CHAR19### give the Bludger a powerful whack in the direction of ###CHAR69### , but the Bludger changed direction in midair and shot straight for ###CHAR68### again. 
Harry dropped quickly to avoid it, and ###CHAR19### managed to hit it hard toward Malfoy. 
Once again, the Bludger swerved like a boomerang and shot at ###CHAR68###'s head. 
###CHAR68### put on a burst of speed and zoomed toward the other end of the pitch. 
###CHAR68### could hear the Bludger whistling along behind ###CHAR68###. 
What was going on? 
Bludgers never concentrated on one player like this; it was their job to try and unseat as many people as possible ... ###CHAR55### was waiting for the Bludger at the other end. 
###CHAR68### ducked as ###CHAR55### swung at the Bludger with all ###CHAR68###'s might; the Bludger was knocked off course. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Gotcha!'' 
###CHAR55### yelled happily, but ###CHAR55### was wrong; as though it was magnetically attracted to ###CHAR68###, the Bludger pelted after ###CHAR68### once more and ###CHAR68### was forced to fly off at full speed. 
It had started to rain; ###CHAR68### felt heavy drops fall onto ###CHAR68###'s face, splattering onto ###CHAR68###'s glasses. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR68### didn't have a clue what was going on in the rest of the game until ###CHAR68### heard ###CHAR97### , who was commentating, say, ``Slytherin lead, sixty points to zero =' The Slytherins' superior brooms were clearly doing their jobs, and meanwhile the mad Bludger was doing all it could to knock ###CHAR68### out of the air. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR55### and ###CHAR19### were now flying so close to ###CHAR55### on either side that ###CHAR68### could see nothing at all except their flailing arms and had no chance to look for the Snitch, let alone catch it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Someone's - tampered - with - this - ###CHAR31### -'' ###CHAR55### grunted, swinging ###CHAR55###'s bat with all ###CHAR55###'s might at it as it launched a new attack on ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We need time out,'' said ###CHAR19###, trying to signal to ###CHAR43### and stop the Bludger breaking ###CHAR68###'s nose at the same time. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR43### had obviously got the message. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR85### 's whistle rang out and ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR55###, and ###CHAR19### dived for the ground, still trying to avoid the mad Bludger. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What's going on?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR43### as the Gryffindor team huddled together, while Slytherins in the crowd jeered. 
###DIALOGUE###``We're being flattened. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR55###, ###CHAR19###, where were you when that ###CHAR31### stopped Angelina scoring?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We were twenty feet above her, stopping the other Bludger from murdering ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR43###,'' said ###CHAR19### angrily. 
###DIALOGUE###``Someone's fixed it - it won't leave ###CHAR68### alone. 
It hasn't gone for anyone else all game. 
###DIALOGUE###The Slytherins must have done something to it.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But the Bludgers have been locked in Madam Hooch's office since our last practice, and there was nothing wrong with them then ... '' said ###CHAR43###, anxiously. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR85### was walking toward them. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Over ###CHAR85###'s shoulder, ###CHAR68### could see the Slytherin team jeering and pointing in ###CHAR68###'s direction. 
###DIALOGUE###``Listen,'' said ###CHAR68### as ###CHAR85### came nearer and nearer, ``with you two flying around me all the time the only way I'm going to catch the Snitch is if it flies up my sleeve. 
###DIALOGUE###Go back to the rest of the team and let me deal with the rogue one.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Don't be thick,'' said ###CHAR55###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It'll take your head off.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR43### was looking from ###CHAR68### to the Weasleys. 
###DIALOGUE###-LRB-I ###CHAR43###, this is insane,'' said Alicia Spinner angrily. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You can't let ###CHAR68### deal with that thing on ###CHAR68###'s own. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Let's ask for an inquiry --RRB--RRB- ``If we stop now, we'll have to forfeit the match!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``And we're not losing to Slytherin just because of a crazy Bludger! 
###DIALOGUE###Come on, ###CHAR43###, tell them to leave me alone!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``This is all your fault,'' ###CHAR19### said angrily to Wood. '' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###`Get the Snitch or die trying,' what a stupid thing to tell ###CHAR68### -'' ###CHAR85### had joined them. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Ready to resume play?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR85### asked ###CHAR43###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Wood looked at the determined look on ###CHAR68###'s face. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``All right,'' ###CHAR68### said. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Fred, ###CHAR19###, you heard ###CHAR68### -leave ###CHAR68### alone and let ###CHAR68### deal with the ###CHAR31### on ###CHAR68###'s own.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The rain was falling more heavily now. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###On Madam Hooch's whistle, ###CHAR68### kicked hard into the air and heard the telltale whoosh of the Bludger behind ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Higher and higher ###CHAR68### climbed; ###CHAR68### looped and swooped, spiraled, zigzagged, and rolled. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Slightly dizzy, ###CHAR68### nevertheless kept ###CHAR68###'s eyes wide open, rain was speckling ###CHAR68###'s glasses and ran up ###CHAR68###'s nostrils as ###CHAR68### hung upside down, avoiding another fierce dive from the Bludger. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### could hear laughter from the crowd; ###CHAR68### knew ###CHAR68### must look very stupid, but the rogue Bludger was heavy and couldn't change direction as quickly as ###CHAR68### could; ###CHAR68### began a kind of roller-coaster ride around the edges of the stadium, squinting through the silver sheets of rain to the Gryffindor goal posts, where ###CHAR69### was trying to get past Wood A whistling in ###CHAR68###'s ear told ###CHAR68### the ###CHAR31### had just missed ###CHAR68### again; ###CHAR68### turned right over and sped in the opposite direction. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Training for the ballet, ###CHAR54###?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###yelled ###CHAR50### as ###CHAR68### was forced to do a stupid kind of twirl in midair to dodge the Bludger, and ###CHAR68### fled, the Bludger trailing a few feet behind ###CHAR68###; and then, glaring back at Malfoy in hatred, he saw it - the Golden Snitch. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It was hovering inches above ###CHAR50###'s left ear - and ###CHAR50###, busy laughing at ###CHAR68###, hadn't seen it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###For an agonizing moment, ###CHAR68### hung in midair, not daring to speed toward ###CHAR50### in case ###CHAR68### looked up and saw the Snitch. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###WHAM. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### had stayed still a second too long. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The Bludger had hit ###CHAR68### at last, smashed into ###CHAR68###'s elbow, and ###CHAR68### felt ###CHAR68###'s arm break. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Dimly, dazed by the searing pain in ###CHAR68###'s arm, ###CHAR68### slid sideways on ###CHAR68###'s rain-drenched broom, one knee still crooked over it, ###CHAR68###'s right arm dangling useless at ###CHAR68###'s side - the Bludger came pelting back for a second attack, this time W-ming at ###CHAR68###'s face - ###CHAR68### swerved out of the way, one idea firmly lodged in ###CHAR68###'s numb brain: get to Malfoy. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Through a haze of rain and pain he dived for the shimmering, sneering face below him and saw its eyes widen with fear: ###CHAR50### thought ###CHAR68### was attacking ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What the -'' ###CHAR68### gasped, careening out of ###CHAR68###'s way. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### took ###CHAR68###'s remaining hand off ###CHAR68###'s broom and made a wild snatch; ###CHAR68### felt ###CHAR68###'s fingers close on the cold Snitch but was now only gripping the broom with ###CHAR68###'s legs, and there was a yell from the crowd below as ###CHAR68### headed straight for the ground, trying hard not to pass out. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###With a splattering thud ###CHAR68### hit the mud and rolled off ###CHAR68###'s broom. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###'s arm was hanging at a very strange angle; riddled with pain, ###CHAR68### heard, as though from a distance, a good deal of whistling and shouting. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### focused on the Snitch clutched in ###CHAR68###'s good hand. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Aha,'' ###CHAR68### said vaguely. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We've won.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###And ###CHAR68### fainted. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### came around, rain falling on ###CHAR68###'s face, still lying on the field, with someone leaning over ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### saw a glitter of teeth. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Oh, no, not you,'' ###CHAR68### moaned. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Doesn't know what ###CHAR54###'s saying,'' said ###CHAR73### loudly to the anxious crowd of Gryffindors pressing around them. 
###DIALOGUE###``Not to worry, ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###I'm about to fix your arm.'' 
###DIALOGUE###``No!
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I'll keep it like this, thanks ...'' ###CHAR73### tried to sit up, but the pain was terrible. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR73### heard a familiar clicking noise nearby. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I don't want a photo of this, ###CHAR66###,'' ###CHAR73### said loudly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Lie back, ###CHAR68###,'' said ###CHAR73### soothingly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It's a simple charm I've used countless times -'' ``Why can't I just go to the hospital wing?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68### through clenched teeth. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR68### should really, Professor,'' said a muddy Wood, who couldn't help grinning even though ###CHAR68###'s Seeker was injured. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Great capture, ###CHAR68###, really spectacular, your best yet, Id say -'' Through the thicket of legs around him, ###CHAR68### spotted ###CHAR55### and ###CHAR19### , wrestling the rogue Bludger into a box. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It was still putting up a terrific fight. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Stand back,'' said ###CHAR73###, who was rolling up ###CHAR73###'s jade-green sleeves. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``No - don't -'' said ###CHAR68### weakly, but ###CHAR73### was twirling ###CHAR68###'s wand and a second later had directed it straight at ###CHAR68###'s arm. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###A strange and unpleasant sensation started at ###CHAR68###'s shoulder and spread all the way down to ###CHAR68###'s fingertips. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It felt as though ###CHAR68###'s arm was being deflated. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### didn't dare look at what was happening. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### had shut ###CHAR68###'s eyes, ###CHAR68###'s face turned away from ###CHAR68###'s arm, but ###CHAR68###'s worst fears were realized as the people above ###CHAR68### gasped and ###CHAR66### began clicking away madly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR66###'s arm didn't hurt anymore - nor did it feel remotely like an arm. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Ah,'' said ###CHAR73###. 
###DIALOGUE###``Yes. 
Well, that can sometimes happen. 
But the point is, the bones are no longer broken. 
That's the thing to bear in mind. 
So, ###CHAR68###, just toddle up to the hospital wing - ah, ###CHAR84### , ###CHAR25### , would you escort ###CHAR84###? 
###DIALOGUE###- and ###CHAR98### will be able to - er - tidy you up a bit.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###As ###CHAR68### got to ###CHAR68###'s feet, ###CHAR68### felt strangely lopsided. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Taking a deep breath ###CHAR68### looked down at ###CHAR68###'s right side. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###What ###CHAR68### saw nearly made ###CHAR68### pass out again. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Poking out of the end of ###CHAR68###'s robes was what looked like a thick, fleshcolored rubber glove. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### tried to move ###CHAR68###'s fingers. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Nothing happened. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR73### hadn't mended ###CHAR68###'s bones. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### had removed them. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR98### wasn't at all pleased. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You should have come straight to me!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR98### raged, holding up the sad, limp remainder of what, half an hour before, had been a working arm. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I can mend bones in a second - but growing them back - '' ``You will be able to, won't you?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68### desperately. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I'll be able to, certainly, but it will be painful,'' said ###CHAR98### grimly, throwing ###CHAR68### a pair of pajamas. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You'll have to stay the night ...'' ###CHAR25### waited outside the curtain drawn around ###CHAR68###'s bed while ###CHAR68### helped ###CHAR68### into ###CHAR68###'s pajamas. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It took a while to stuff the rubbery, boneless arm into a sleeve. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``How can you stick up for ###CHAR73### now, ###CHAR25###, eh?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### called through the curtain as ###CHAR68### pulled ###CHAR68###'s limp fingers through the cuff. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``If ###CHAR68### had wanted deboning ###CHAR68### would have asked.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Anyone can make a mistake,'' said ###CHAR25###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``And it doesn't hurt anymore, does it, ###CHAR68###?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``No,'' said ###CHAR68###, getting into bed. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But it doesn't do anything else either.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###As ###CHAR68### swung himself onto the bed, ###CHAR68###'s arm flapped pointlessly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR25### and ###CHAR98### came around the curtain. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR98### was holding a large bottle of something labeled Skele-Gro. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You're in for a rough night,'' ###CHAR98### said, pouring out a steaming beakerful and handing it to ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``Regrowing bones is a nasty business. 
So was taking the Skele-Gro. 
It burned ###CHAR68###'s mouth and throat as it went down, making ###CHAR68### cough and splutter. 
Still tut-tutting about dangerous sports and inept teachers, ###CHAR98### re treated, leaving ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### to help ###CHAR68### gulp down some water. 
###DIALOGUE###``We won, though,'' said ###CHAR68###, a grin breaking across ###CHAR68###'s face. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``That was some catch you made. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR50###'s face ... ###CHAR68### looked ready to kill ...'' ``I want to know how ###CHAR68### fixed that Bludger,'' said ###CHAR25### darkly. 
###DIALOGUE###``We can add that to the list of questions we'll ask ###CHAR68### when we've taken the Polyjuice Potion,'' said ###CHAR68###, sinking back onto ###CHAR68###'s pillows. 
###DIALOGUE###``I hope it tastes better than this stuff ... ``If it's got bits of Slytherins in it? 
###DIALOGUE###You've got to be joking,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The door of the hospital wing burst open at that moment. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Filthy and soaking wet, the rest of the Gryffindor team had arrived to see ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Unbelievable flying, ###CHAR68###,'' said ###CHAR19###. 
###DIALOGUE###``I've just seen Mar cus Flint yelling at Malfoy. 
Something about having the Snitch on top of ###CHAR68###'s head and not noticing. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR50### didn't seem too happy.'' 
###DIALOGUE###They had brought cakes, sweets, and bottles of pumpkin juice; they gathered around ###CHAR68###'s bed and were just getting started on what promised to be a good party when ###CHAR98### came storming over, shouting, ``This boy needs rest, he's got thirty-three bones to regrow! 
Out! 
###DIALOGUE###OUT!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###And ###CHAR68### was left alone, with nothing to distract ###CHAR68### from the stabbing pains in ###CHAR68###'s limp arm. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Hours and hours later, ###CHAR68### woke quite suddenly in the pitch blackness and gave a small yelp of pain: ###CHAR68###'s arm now felt full of large splinters. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###For a second, ###CHAR68### thought that was what had woken ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Then, with a thrill of horror, ###CHAR68### realized that someone was sponging ###CHAR68###'s forehead in the dark. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Get off!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### said loudly, and then, ``Dobby!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The house-elf's goggling tennis ball eyes were peering at Harry through the darkness. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###A single tear was running down his long, pointed nose. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR54### came back to school,'' he whispered miserably. 
###DIALOGUE###``###CHAR48### warned and warned ###CHAR54### . 
Ah sir, why didn't you heed ###CHAR48###? 
###DIALOGUE###Why didn't ###CHAR54### go back home when ###CHAR54### missed the train?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### heaved himself up on ###CHAR68###'s pillows and pushed ###CHAR48###'s sponge away. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What're you doing here?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### said. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``And how did you know I missed the train?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR48###'s lip trembled and ###CHAR68### was seized by a sudden suspicion. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It was you!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### said slowly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You stopped the barrier from letting us through!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Indeed yes, sir,'' said ###CHAR48###, nodding ###CHAR68###'s head vigorously, ears flapping. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR48### hid and watched for ###CHAR54### and sealed the gateway and ###CHAR48### had to iron ###CHAR54###'s hands afterward'' - ###CHAR68### showed ###CHAR68### ten long, bandaged fingers - ``but ###CHAR48### didn't care, sir, for ###CHAR54### thought ###CHAR54### was safe, and never did ###CHAR48### dream that ###CHAR54### would get to school another way!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### was rocking backward and forward, shaking ###CHAR68###'s ugly head. 
###DIALOGUE###``###CHAR48### was `so shocked when ###CHAR54### heard ###CHAR54### was back at Hogwarts, ###CHAR54### let ###CHAR54###'s master's dinner burn! 
Such a flogging ###CHAR48### never had, sir . 
... ###CHAR68### slumped back onto ###CHAR68###'s pillows. 
###DIALOGUE###``You nearly got ###CHAR68### and me expelled,'' ###CHAR68### said fiercely. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You'd better get lost before my bones come back, ###CHAR48###, or I might strangle you.'' 
###CHAR48### smiled weakly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Dobby is used to death threats, sir. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR48### gets them five times a day at home.'' 
###CHAR68### blew ###CHAR68###'s nose on a corner of the filthy pillowcase ###CHAR68### wore, looking so pathetic that ###CHAR68### felt ###CHAR68###'s anger ebb away in spite of himself. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Why d'you wear that thing, ###CHAR48###?'' 
###CHAR68### asked curiously. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``This, sir?'' 
###DIALOGUE###said ###CHAR48###, plucking at the pillowcase. ''
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###`Tis a mark of the house-elf's enslavement, sir. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR48### can only be freed if ###CHAR68###'s masters present ###CHAR68### with clothes, sir. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The family is careful not to pass ###CHAR48### even a sock, sir, for then ###CHAR68### would be free to leave their house forever.'' 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR48### mopped ###CHAR68###'s bulging eyes and said suddenly, ``###CHAR54### must go home! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR48### thought ###CHAR54###'s Bludger would be enough to make -'' ``Your Bludger?'' 
said ###CHAR68###, anger rising once more. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What d'you mean, your Bludger? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###You made that Bludger try and kill me?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Not kill you, sir, never kill you!'' 
said ###CHAR48###, shocked. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR48### wants to save ###CHAR54### 's life! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Better sent home, grievously injured, than remain here sir! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR48### only wanted ###CHAR54### hurt enough to be sent home!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Oh, is that all?'' 
said ###CHAR68### angrily. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you wanted me sent home in pieces?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Ah, if ###CHAR54### only knew!'' 
###CHAR48### groaned, more tears dripping onto ###CHAR68###'s ragged pillowcase. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``If ###CHAR54### knew what ###CHAR54### means to us, to the lowly, the enslaved, we dregs of the magical world! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR48### remembers how it was when He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was at the height of ###CHAR54###'s powers, sir! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###We house-elfs were treated like vermin, sir! 
###DIALOGUE###Of course, ###CHAR48### is still treated like that, sir,'' ###CHAR68### admitted, drying ###CHAR68###'s face on the pillowcase. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But mostly, sir, life has improved for my kind since you triumphed over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR54### survived, and the Dark Lord's power was broken, and it was a new dawn, sir, and ###CHAR54### shone like a beacon of hope for those of us who thought the Dark days would never end, sit... And now, at Hogwarts, terrible things are to happen, are perhaps happening already, and ###CHAR48### cannot let ###CHAR54### stay here now that history is to repeat itself, now that the Chamber of Secrets is open once more ###CHAR48### froze, horrorstruck, then grabbed ###CHAR68###'s water jug from ###CHAR68###'s bedside table and cracked it over ###CHAR68###'s own head, toppling out of sight. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###A second later, ###CHAR68### crawled back onto the bed, cross-eyed, muttering, ``Bad ###CHAR48###, very bad Dobby...'' ``So there is a Chamber of Secrets?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### whispered. 
###DIALOGUE###``And did you say it's been opened before? 
###DIALOGUE###Tell me, ###CHAR48###!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### seized the elf's bony wrist as ###CHAR48###'s hand inched toward the water jug. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But I'm not Muggle-born - how can I be in danger from the Chamber?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Ah, sir, ask no more, ask no more of poor ###CHAR48###,'' stammered the elf, ###CHAR68###'s eyes huge in the dark. 
###DIALOGUE###``Dark deeds are planned in this place, but ###CHAR54### must not be here when they happen - go home, ###CHAR54### , go home. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR54### must not meddle in this, sir, `tis too dangerous -'' ``Who is it, ###CHAR48###?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### said, keeping a firm hold on ###CHAR48###'s wrist to stop ###CHAR68### from hitting himself with the water jug again. 
###DIALOGUE###``Who's opened it? 
###DIALOGUE###Who opened it last time?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Dobby can't, sir, ###CHAR48### can't, ###CHAR48### mustn't tell!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###squealed the elf. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Go home, ###CHAR54### , go home!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I'm not going anywhere!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68### fiercely. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``One of my best friends is Muggle-born; she'll be first in line if the Chamber really has been opened -'' ``###CHAR54### risks ###CHAR54###'s own life for ###CHAR54###'s friends!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###moaned ###CHAR48### in a kind of miserable ecstasy. 
###DIALOGUE###``So noble! 
So valiant! 
###DIALOGUE###But ###CHAR54### must save himself, ###CHAR54### must, ###CHAR54### must not -'' ###CHAR48### suddenly froze, ###CHAR68###'s bat ears quivering. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### heard it, too. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There were footsteps coming down the passageway outside. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Dobby must go!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###breathed the elf, terrified. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There was a loud crack, and ###CHAR68###'s fist was suddenly clenched on thin air. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### slumped back into bed, ###CHAR68###'s eyes on the dark doorway to the hospital wing as the footsteps drew nearer. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Next moment, ###CHAR94### was backing into the dormitory, wearing a long woolly dressing gown and a nightcap. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR94### was carrying one end of what looked like a statue. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Professor ###CHAR96### appeared a second later, carrying its feet. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Together, they heaved it onto a bed. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Get Madam Pomfrey,'' whispered ###CHAR94###, and Professor ###CHAR96### hurried past the end of ###CHAR68###'s bed out of sight. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### lay quite still, pretending to be asleep. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### heard urgent voices, and then Professor ###CHAR96### swept back into view, closely followed by ###CHAR98### , who was pulling a cardigan on over ###CHAR98###'s nightdress. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### heard a sharp intake of breath. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What happened?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR98### whispered to ###CHAR94###, bending over the statue on the bed. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Another attack,'' said ###CHAR94###. 
###DIALOGUE###``Minerva found ###CHAR54### on the stairs. 
###DIALOGUE###``There was a bunch of grapes next to ###CHAR54###,'' said Professor ###CHAR96###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We think ###CHAR54### was trying to sneak up here to visit ###CHAR54###.'' 
###CHAR68###'s stomach gave a horrible lurch. 
Slowly and carefully, ###CHAR68### raised himself a few inches so ###CHAR68### could look at the statue on the bed. 
A ray of moonlight lay across its staring face. 
It was ###CHAR66### . 
###CHAR66###'s eyes were wide and ###CHAR66###'s hands were stuck up in front of ###CHAR66###, holding ###CHAR66###'s camera. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Petrified?'' 
whispered ###CHAR98### . 
###DIALOGUE###``Yes,'' said Professor ###CHAR96###. 
###DIALOGUE###``But I shudder to think ... If ###CHAR94### hadn't been on the way downstairs for hot chocolate - who knows what might have -'' The three of them stared down at Colin. 
Then ###CHAR94### leaned forward and wrenched the camera out of ###CHAR66###'s rigid grip. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You don't think ###CHAR94### managed to get a picture of ###CHAR94###'s attacker?'' 
said Professor ###CHAR96### eagerly. 
###CHAR94### didn't answer. 
###CHAR94### opened the back of the camera. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Good gracious!'' 
said ###CHAR98### . 
A jet of steam had hissed out of the camera. 
###CHAR68###, three beds away, caught the acrid smell of burnt plastic. 
###DIALOGUE###``Melted,'' said Madam Pomfrey wonderingly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``All melted...'' ``What does this mean, ###CHAR94###?'' 
Professor ###CHAR96### asked urgently. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It means,'' said ###CHAR94###, ``that the Chamber of Secrets is indeed open again.'' 
###CHAR98### clapped a hand to ###CHAR98###'s mouth. 
Professor ###CHAR96### stared at ###CHAR94###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But, ###CHAR94### ... surely ... who?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``The question is not who,'' said ###CHAR94###, ###CHAR94###'s eyes on Colin. 
###DIALOGUE###``The question is, how ...'' And from what ###CHAR68### could see of Professor ###CHAR96###'s shad owy face, ###CHAR98### didn't understand this any better than he did.
THE DUELLING CLUB
###CHAR68### woke up on Sunday morning to find the dormitory blazing with winter sunlight and ###CHAR68###'s arm reboned but very stiff. 
###CHAR68### sat up quickly and looked over at Colin's bed, but it had been blocked from view by the high curtains ###CHAR68### had changed behind yesterday. 
Seeing that ###CHAR68### was awake, ###CHAR98### came bustling over with a breakfast tray and then began bending and stretching ###CHAR68###'s arm and fingers. 
###DIALOGUE###``All in order,'' ###CHAR98### said as ###CHAR68### clumsily fed himself porridge lefthanded. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``When you've finished eating, you may leave.'' 
###CHAR68### dressed as quickly as ###CHAR68### could and hurried off to ###CHAR81### , desperate to tell ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### about ###CHAR66### and ###CHAR48###, but they weren't there. 
###CHAR68### left to look for them, wondering where they could have got to and feeling slightly hurt that they weren't interested in whether ###CHAR68### had ###CHAR68###'s bones back or not. 
As ###CHAR68### passed the library, ###CHAR70### strolled out of it, looking in far better spirits than last time they'd met. 
###DIALOGUE###``Oh, hello, ###CHAR68###,'' ###CHAR68### said. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Excellent flying yesterday, really excellent. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Gryffindor has just taken the lead for the House Cup you earned fifty points!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You haven't seen ###CHAR68### or Hermione, have you?'' 
said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``No, I haven't,'' said ###CHAR70###, ###CHAR68###'s smile fading. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I hope ###CHAR68###'s not in another girls' toilet ... ###CHAR68### forced a laugh, watched ###CHAR70### walk out of sight, and then headed straight for Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### couldn't see why ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### would be in there again, but after making sure that neither Filch nor any prefects were around, ###CHAR68### opened the door and heard their voices coming from a locked stall. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It's me,'' ###CHAR68### said, closing the door behind ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There was a clunk, a splash, and a gasp from within the stall and ###CHAR68### saw ###CHAR25###'s eye peering through the keyhole. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###`###CHAR68###!'' 
###CHAR25### said. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You gave us such a fright - come in how's your arm?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Fine,'' said ###CHAR68###, squeezing into the stall. 
An old cauldron was perched on the toilet, and a crackling from under the rim told ###CHAR68### they had lit a fire beneath it. 
Conjuring up portable, waterproof fires was a speciality of ###CHAR25###'s. 
###DIALOGUE###``We'd've come to meet you, but we decided to get started on the Polyjuice Potion,'' ###CHAR68### explained as ###CHAR68###, with difficulty, locked the stall again. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We've decided this is the safest place to hide it.'' 
###CHAR68### started to tell them about ###CHAR66###, but ###CHAR25### interrupted. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We already know - we heard Professor ###CHAR96### telling Professor ###CHAR2### this morning. 
###DIALOGUE###That's why we decided we'd better get going -'' ``The sooner we get a confession out of Malfoy, the better,'' snarled ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``D'you know what I think? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###He was in such a foul temper after the Quidditch match, he took it out on Colin.'' 
###DIALOGUE###``There's something else,'' said ###CHAR68###, watching ###CHAR25### tearing bundles of knotgrass and throwing them into the potion. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Dobby came to visit me in the middle of the night.'' 
###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### looked up, amazed. 
###CHAR68### told them everything ###CHAR48### had told ###CHAR68### - or hadn't told ###CHAR68###. 
###CHAR25### and ###CHAR68### listened with their mouths open. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``The Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?'' 
###CHAR25### said. 
###DIALOGUE###``This settles it,'' said ###CHAR68### in a triumphant voice. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR50### must've opened the Chamber when ###CHAR50### was at school here and now ###CHAR50###'s told dear old ###CHAR0### how to do it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It's obvious. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Wish Dobby'd told you what kind of monster's in there, though. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I want to know how come nobody's noticed it sneaking around the school.'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Maybe it can make itself invisible,'' said ###CHAR25###, prodding leeches to the bottom of the cauldron. 
###DIALOGUE###``Or maybe it can disguise itself - pretend to be a suit of armor or something - I've read about Chameleon Ghouls -'' ``You read too much, ###CHAR25###,'' said ###CHAR68###, pouring dead lacewings on top of the leeches. 
###CHAR68### crumpled up the empty lacewing bag and looked at Harry. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``So ###CHAR48### stopped us from getting on the train and broke your arm ###CHAR0### shook ###CHAR0###'s head. 
###DIALOGUE###``You know what, ###CHAR68###? 
###DIALOGUE###If ###CHAR68### doesn't stop trying to save your life ###CHAR68###'s going to kill you.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The news that ###CHAR66### had been attacked and was now lying as though dead in the hospital wing had spread through the entire school by Monday morning. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The air was suddenly thick with rumor and suspicion. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The first years were now moving around the castle in tight-knit groups, as though scared they would be attacked if they ventured forth alone. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR76### , who sat next to ###CHAR66### in Charms, was distraught, but ###CHAR68### felt that ###CHAR55### and ###CHAR19### were going the wrong way about cheering ###CHAR76###'s up. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They were taking turns covering themselves with fur or boils and jumping out at ###CHAR76###'s from behind statues. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They only stopped when ###CHAR70###, apoplectic with rage, told them ###CHAR70### was going to write to ###CHAR83### and tell ###CHAR83### ###CHAR76### was having nightmares. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Meanwhile, hidden from the teachers, a roaring trade in talismans, amulets, and other protective devices was sweeping the school. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR92### bought a large, evil-smelling green onion, a pointed purple crystal, and a rotting newt tail before the other Gryffindor boys pointed out that ###CHAR92### was in no danger; ###CHAR92### was a pureblood, and therefore unlikely to be attacked. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``They went for Filch first,'' ###CHAR92### said, ###CHAR92###'s round face fearful. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``And everyone knows I'm almost a Squib.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###In the second week of December Professor ###CHAR96### came around as usual, collecting names of those who would be staying at school for Christmas. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###, ###CHAR68###, and ###CHAR25### signed ###CHAR25###'s list; they had heard that ###CHAR50### was staying, which struck them as very suspicious. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The holidays would be the perfect time to use the Polyjuice Potion and try to worm a confession out of ###CHAR50###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Unfortunately, the potion was only half finished. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They still needed the bicorn horn and the boomslang skin, and the only place they were going to get them was from ###CHAR63###'s private stores. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### privately felt ###CHAR68###'d rather face ###CHAR45###'s legendary monster than let ###CHAR63### catch ###CHAR63### robbing ###CHAR63###'s office. 
###DIALOGUE###``What we need,'' said ###CHAR25### briskly as Thursday afternoon's double Potions lesson loomed nearer, ``is a diversion. 
###DIALOGUE###Then one of us can sneak into ###CHAR63###'s office and take what we need.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### looked at ###CHAR25###'s nervously. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I think Id better do the actual stealing,'' ###CHAR25### continued in a matter-of-fact tone. 
###DIALOGUE###``You two will be expelled if you get into any more trouble, and I've got a clean record. 
So all you need to do is cause enough mayhem to keep ###CHAR63### busy for five minutes or so. 
###CHAR68### smiled feebly. 
Deliberately causing mayhem in ###CHAR63###'s Potions class was about as safe as poking a sleeping dragon in the eye. 
Potions lessons took place in one of the large dungeons. 
Thursday afternoon's lesson proceeded in the usual way. 
Twenty cauldrons stood steaming between the wooden desks, on which stood brass scales and jars of ingredients. 
###CHAR63### prowled through the fumes, making waspish remarks about the Gryffindors' work while the Slytherins sniggered appreciatively. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR0### , who was ###CHAR63###'s favorite student, kept flicking puffer-fish eyes at ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68###, who knew that if they retaliated they would get detention faster than you could say ``Unfair.'' 
###CHAR68###'s Swelling Solution was far too runny, but ###CHAR68### had ###CHAR68###'s mind on more important things. 
###CHAR68### was waiting for ###CHAR25###'s signal, and ###CHAR68### hardly listened as ###CHAR63### paused to sneer at ###CHAR63###'s watery potion. 
When ###CHAR63### turned and walked off to bully ###CHAR92###, ###CHAR25### caught ###CHAR68###'s eye and nodded. 
###CHAR68### ducked swiftly down behind ###CHAR68###'s cauldron, pulled one of ###CHAR55###'s Filibuster fireworks out of ###CHAR68###'s pocket, and gave it a quick prod with ###CHAR68###'s wand. 
The firework began to fizz and sputter. 
Knowing ###CHAR68### had only seconds, ###CHAR68### straightened up, took aim, and lobbed it into the air; it landed right on target in Goyle's cauldron. 
###CHAR6###'s potion exploded, showering the whole class. 
People shrieked as splashes of the Swelling Solution hit them. 
###CHAR50### got a faceful and ###CHAR50###'s nose began to swell like a balloon; ###CHAR6### blundered around, ###CHAR50###'s hands over ###CHAR50###'s eyes, which had expanded to the size of a dinner plate - ###CHAR63### was trying to restore calm and find out what had happened. 
Through the confusion, ###CHAR68### saw ###CHAR25### slip quietly into ###CHAR63###'s office. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Silence! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###SILENCE!'' 
###CHAR63### roared. 
###DIALOGUE###``Anyone who has been splashed, come here for a Deflating Draft - when I find out who did this -'' ###CHAR68### tried not to laugh as ###CHAR68### watched ###CHAR50### hurry forward, ###CHAR68###'s head drooping with the weight of a nose like a small melon. 
As half the class lumbered up to ###CHAR63###'s desk, some weighted down with arms like clubs, others unable to talk through gigantic puffedup lips, Harry saw Hermione slide back into the dungeon, the front of her robes bulging. 
When everyone had taken a swig of antidote and the various swellings had subsided, ###CHAR63### swept over to ###CHAR6###'s cauldron and scooped out the twisted black remains of the firework. 
There was a sudden hush. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``If I ever find out who threw this,'' ###CHAR63### whispered, ``I shall make sure that person is expelled.'' 
###CHAR68### arranged ###CHAR68###'s face into what ###CHAR68### hoped was a puzzled expression. 
###CHAR63### was looking right at ###CHAR63###, and the bell that rang ten minutes later could not have been more welcome. 
###DIALOGUE###``###CHAR68### knew it was me,'' ###CHAR68### told ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### as they hurried back to Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I could tell.'' 
###CHAR25### threw the new ingredients into the cauldron and began to stir feverishly. 
###DIALOGUE###``It'll be ready in two weeks,'' ###CHAR25### said happily. 
###DIALOGUE###``###CHAR63### can't prove it was you,'' said ###CHAR68### reassuringly to ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What can ###CHAR63### do?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Knowing ###CHAR63###, something foul,'' said ###CHAR68### as the potion frothed and bubbled. 
A week later, ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR68###, and ###CHAR25### were walking across the entrance hall when they saw a small knot of people gathered around the notice board, reading a piece of parchment that had just been pinned up. 
###CHAR4### and ###CHAR28### beckoned them over, looking excited. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``They're starting a Dueling Club!'' 
said ###CHAR4###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``First meeting tonight! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I wouldn't mind dueling lessons; they might come in handy one of these days ...'' ``What, you reckon ###CHAR45###'s monster can duel?'' 
said ###CHAR68###, but ###CHAR68###, too, read the sign with interest. 
###DIALOGUE###``Could be useful,'' ###CHAR68### said to ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### as they went into dinner. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Shall we go?'' 
###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### were all for it, so at eight o'clock that evening they hurried back to the Great Hall. 
The long dining tables had vanished and a golden stage had appeared along one wall, lit by thousands of candles floating overhead. 
The ceiling was velvety black once more and most of the school seemed to be packed beneath it, all carrying their wands and looking excited. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I wonder who'll be teaching us?'' 
said ###CHAR25### as they edged into the chattering crowd. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Someone told me ###CHAR2### was a dueling champion when he was young - maybe it'll be him.'' 
###DIALOGUE###``As long as it's not -'' ###CHAR68### began, but ###CHAR68### ended on a groan: ###CHAR73### was walking onto the stage, resplendent in robes of deep plum and accompanied by none other than ###CHAR63###, wearing ###CHAR63###'s usual black. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR73### waved an arm for silence and called ' ``Gather round, gather round! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Can everyone see me? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Can you all hear me? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Excellent! 
###DIALOGUE###``Now, Professor ###CHAR94### has granted me permission to start this little dueling club, to train you all in case you ever need to defend yourselves as I myself have done on countless occasions - for full details, see my published works. 
###DIALOGUE###``Let me introduce my assistant, Professor ###CHAR63###,'' said ###CHAR73###, flashing a wide smile. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR63### tells me ###CHAR63### knows a tiny little bit about dueling himself and has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration before we begin. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Now, I don't want any of you youngsters to worry - you'll still have your Potions master when I'm through with ###CHAR63###, never fear!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Wouldn't it be good if they finished each other off?'' 
###CHAR68### muttered in ###CHAR68###'s ear. 
###CHAR63###'s upper lip was curling. 
###CHAR68### wondered why ###CHAR73### was still smiling; if ###CHAR63### had been looking at ###CHAR63### like that ###CHAR63###'d have been running as fast as ###CHAR63### could in the opposite direction. 
###CHAR73### and ###CHAR63### turned to face each other and bowed; at least, ###CHAR73### did, with much twirling of ###CHAR73###'s hands, whereas ###CHAR63### jerked ###CHAR73###'s head irritably. 
Then they raised their wands like swords in front of them. 
###DIALOGUE###``As you see, we are holding our wands in the accepted combative position,'' ###CHAR73### told the silent crowd. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``On the count of three, we will cast our first spells. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Neither of us will be aiming to kill, of course.'' 
###DIALOGUE###``I wouldn't bet on that,'' ###CHAR68### murmured, watching ###CHAR63### baring ###CHAR63###'s teeth. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``One - two - three -'' Both of them swung their wands above their heads and pointed them at their opponent; ###CHAR63### cried: ``Expelliarmus!'' 
There was a dazzling flash of scarlet light and ###CHAR73### was blasted off ###CHAR73###'s feet: ###CHAR73### flew backward off the stage, smashed into the wall, and slid down it to sprawl on the floor. 
###CHAR50### and some of the other Slytherins cheered. 
###CHAR25### was dancing on tiptoes. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Do you think ###CHAR63###'s all right?'' 
###CHAR25### squealed through ###CHAR25###'s fingers. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Who cares?'' 
said ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### together. 
###CHAR73### was getting unsteadily to ###CHAR73###'s feet. 
###CHAR73###'s hat had fallen off and ###CHAR73###'s wavy hair was standing on end. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Well, there you have it!'' 
###CHAR73### said, tottering back onto the platform. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``That was a Disarming Charm - as you see, I've lost my wand - ah, thank you, Miss Brown - yes, an excellent idea to show them that, Professor ###CHAR63###, but if you don't mind my saying so, it was very obvious what you were about to do. 
###DIALOGUE###If I had wanted to stop you it would have been only too easy - however, I felt it would be instructive to let them see ...'' ###CHAR63### was looking murderous. 
###DIALOGUE###Possibly ###CHAR73### had noticed, because ###CHAR73### said, ``Enough demonstrating! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I'm going to come amongst you now and put you all into pairs. 
###DIALOGUE###Professor ###CHAR63###, if you'd like to help me -'' They moved through the crowd, matching up partners. 
###CHAR73### teamed ###CHAR92### with ###CHAR100### , but ###CHAR63### reached ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### first. 
###DIALOGUE###``Time to split up the dream team, I think,'' ###CHAR63### sneered. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR55###, you can partner ###CHAR4###. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR54### -'' ###CHAR68### moved automatically toward ###CHAR25###. 
###DIALOGUE###``I don't think so,'' said ###CHAR63###, smiling coldly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR50### , come over here. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Let's see what you make of the famous ###CHAR54###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###And you, ###CHAR25### - you can partner Miss Bulstrode.'' 
###CHAR50### strutted over, smirking. 
Behind ###CHAR63### walked a Slytherin girl who reminded ###CHAR68### of a picture ###CHAR68###'d seen in Holidays with Hags. 
She was large and square and her heavy jaw jutted aggressively. 
###CHAR25### gave ###CHAR25### a weak smile that ###CHAR25### did not return. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Face your partners!'' 
called ###CHAR73###, back on the platform. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``And bow!'' 
###CHAR68### and ###CHAR50### barely inclined their heads, not taking their eyes off each other. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Wands at the ready!'' 
shouted ###CHAR73###. 
###DIALOGUE###``When I count to three, cast your charms to disarm your opponents - only to disarm them - we don't want any accidents - one ... two ... three -'' ###CHAR68### swung ###CHAR68###'s wand high, but ###CHAR50### had already started on ``two'': ###CHAR50###'s spell hit ###CHAR68### so hard ###CHAR68### felt as though ###CHAR68###'d been hit over the head with a saucepan. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR68### stumbled, but everything still seemed to be working, and wasting no more time, ###CHAR68### pointed ###CHAR68###'s wand straight at Malfoy and shouted, ``Rictusempra!'' 
A jet of silver light hit ###CHAR50### in the stomach and ###CHAR50### doubled up, wheezing. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I said disarm only!'' 
###CHAR73### shouted in alarm over the heads of the battling crowd, as ###CHAR50### sank to ###CHAR50###'s knees; ###CHAR68### had hit ###CHAR68### with a Tickling Charm, and ###CHAR68### could barely move for laughing. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR68### hung back, with a vague feeling it would be unsporting to bewitch ###CHAR50### while ###CHAR50### was on the floor, but this was a mistake; gasping for breath, ###CHAR50### pointed ###CHAR50###'s wand at ###CHAR68###'s knees, choked, ``Tarantallegra!'' 
and the next second ###CHAR68###'s legs began to jerk around out of ###CHAR68###'s control in a kind of quickstep. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Stop! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Stop!'' 
screamed ###CHAR73###, but ###CHAR63### took charge. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Finite Incantatem!'' 
###CHAR63### shouted; ###CHAR68###'s feet stopped dancing, ###CHAR50### stopped laughing, and they were able to look up. 
A haze of greenish smoke was hovering over the scene. 
Both ###CHAR92### and ###CHAR100### were lying on the floor, panting; ###CHAR68### was holding up an ashen-faced ###CHAR4###, apologizing for whatever ###CHAR68###'s broken wand had done; but ###CHAR25### and ###CHAR93### were still moving; ###CHAR93### had ###CHAR25### in a headlock and ###CHAR25### was whimpering in pain; both their wands lay forgotten on the floor. 
Harry leapt forward and pulled Millicent off. 
It was difficult: She was a lot bigger than he was. 
###DIALOGUE###``Dear, dear,'' said ###CHAR73###, skittering through the crowd, looking at the aftermath of the duels. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Up you go, ###CHAR40### ... Careful there, Miss Fawcett ... Pinch it hard, it'll stop bleeding in a second, Boot ``I think Id better teach you how to block unfriendly spells,'' said ###CHAR73###, standing flustered in the midst of the hall. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR73### glanced at Snape, whose black eyes glinted, and looked quickly away. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Let's have a volunteer pair - ###CHAR92### and Finch-Fletchley, how about you -'' ``A bad idea, Professor ###CHAR73###,'' said ###CHAR63###, gliding over like a large and malevolent bat. 
###DIALOGUE###``###CHAR92### causes devastation with the simplest spells. 
###DIALOGUE###We'll be sending what's left of Finch-Fletchley up to the hospital wing in a matchbox.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR92###'s round, pink face went pinker. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``How about ###CHAR50### and ###CHAR54###?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR63### with a twisted smile. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Excellent idea!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR73###, gesturing ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR50### into the middle of the hall as the crowd backed away to give them room. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Now, ###CHAR68###,'' said ###CHAR73###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``When ###CHAR0### points ###CHAR68###'s wand at you, you do this.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR73### raised ###CHAR73###'s own wand, attempted a complicated sort of wiggling action, and dropped it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR63### smirked as ###CHAR73### quickly picked it up, saying, ``Whoops -my wand is a little overexcited -'' ###CHAR63### moved closer to Malfoy, bent down, and whispered something in ###CHAR63###'s ear. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR50### smirked, too. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### looked up nervously at ###CHAR73### and said, ``Professor, could you show me that blocking thing again?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Scared?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###muttered ###CHAR50###, so that ###CHAR73### couldn't hear ###CHAR73###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You wish,'' said ###CHAR68### out of the corner of ###CHAR68###'s mouth. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR73### cuffed ###CHAR68### merrily on the shoulder. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Just do what I did, ###CHAR68###!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What, drop my wand?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###But ###CHAR73### wasn't listening. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Three - two - one - go!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR73### shouted. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR50### raised ###CHAR50###'s wand quickly and bellowed, ``Serpensortia!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The end of ###CHAR50###'s wand exploded. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### watched, aghast, as a long black snake shot out of it, fell heavily onto the floor between them, and raised itself, ready to strike. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There were screams as the crowd backed swiftly away, clearing the floor. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Don't move, ###CHAR54###,'' said ###CHAR63### lazily, clearly enjoying the sight of ###CHAR68### standing motionless, eye to eye with the angry snake. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I'll get rid of it ...'' ``Allow me!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###shouted ###CHAR73###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR73### brandished ###CHAR73###'s wand at the snake and there was a loud bang; the snake, instead of vanishing, flew ten feet into the air and fell back to the floor with a loud smack. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Enraged, hissing furiously, it slithered straight toward ###CHAR100### and raised itself again, fangs exposed, poised to strike. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### wasn't sure what made ###CHAR68### do it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### wasn't even aware of deciding to do it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###All ###CHAR68### knew was that ###CHAR68###'s legs were carrying ###CHAR68### forward as though ###CHAR68### was on casters and that ###CHAR68### had shouted stupidly at the snake, ``Leave ###CHAR54### alone!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###And miraculously - inexplicably - the snake slumped to the floor, docile as a thick, black garden hose, its eyes now on ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### felt the fear drain out of ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### knew the snake wouldn't attack anyone now, though how ###CHAR68### knew it, ###CHAR68### couldn't have explained. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### looked up at ###CHAR100###, grinning, expecting to see ###CHAR100### looking relieved, or puzzled, or even grateful - but certainly not angry and scared. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What do you think you're playing at?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR100### shouted, and before ###CHAR68### could say anything, ###CHAR100### had turned and stormed out of the hall. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR63### stepped forward, waved ###CHAR63###'s wand, and the snake vanished in a small puff of black smoke. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR63###, too, was looking at ###CHAR68### in an unexpected way: It was a shrewd and calculating look, and ###CHAR68### didn't like it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### was also dimly aware of an ominous muttering all around the walls. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Then ###CHAR68### felt a tugging on the back of ###CHAR68###'s robes. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Come on,'' said Rods voice in ###CHAR68###'s ear. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Move - come on -'' ###CHAR68### steered ###CHAR68### out of the hall, ###CHAR25### hurrying alongside them. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###As they went through the doors, the people on either side drew away as though they were frightened of catching something. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### didn't have a clue what was going on, and neither ###CHAR68### nor ###CHAR25### explained anything until they had dragged ###CHAR68### all the way up to the empty Gryffindor common room. 
###DIALOGUE###Then ###CHAR68### pushed ###CHAR68### into an armchair and said, ``You're a Parselmouth. 
###DIALOGUE###Why didn't you tell us?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I'm a what?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###`A Parselmouth!'' 
said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You can talk to snakes!'' 
###DIALOGUE###``I know,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I mean, that's only the second time I've ever done it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I accidentally set a boa constrictor on my cousin ###CHAR1### at the zoo once - long story - but it was telling me it had never seen Brazil and I sort of set it free without meaning to that was before I knew I was a wizard -'' ``A boa constrictor told you it had never seen Brazil?'' 
###CHAR68### repeated faintly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``So?'' 
said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I bet loads of people here can do it.'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Oh, no they can't,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It's not a very common gift. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###, this is bad.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What's bad?'' 
said ###CHAR68###, starting to feel quite angry. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What's wrong with everyone? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Listen, if I hadn't told that snake not to attack ###CHAR100### -'' ``Oh, that's what you said to it?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What d'you mean? 
###DIALOGUE###You were there - you heard me -'' ``I heard you speaking Parseltongue,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Snake language. 
###DIALOGUE###You could have been saying anything - no wonder ###CHAR100### panicked, you sounded like you were egging the snake on or something - it was creepy, you know -'' ###CHAR68### gaped at ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I spoke a different language? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###But - I didn't realize - how can I speak a language without knowing I can speak it?'' 
###CHAR68### shook ###CHAR68###'s head. 
Both ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### were looking as though someone had died. 
Harry couldn't see what was so terrible. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``D'you want to tell me what's wrong with stopping a massive snake biting off ###CHAR100###'s head?'' 
he said. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What does it matter how I did it as long as ###CHAR100### doesn't have to join the Headless Hunt?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It matters,'' said ###CHAR25###, speaking at last in a hushed voice, ``because being able to talk to snakes was what ###CHAR45### was famous for. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###That's why the symbol of ###CHAR47### is a serpent.'' 
###CHAR68###'s mouth fell open. 
###DIALOGUE###``Exactly,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``And now the whole school's going to think you're ###CHAR45###'s great-great-great-great-grandson or something -'' ``But I'm not,'' said ###CHAR68###, with a panic ###CHAR68### couldn't quite explain. 
###DIALOGUE###``You'll find that hard to prove,'' said ###CHAR25###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR45### lived about a thousand years ago; for all we know, you could be.'' 
###CHAR68### lay awake for hours that night. 
Through a gap in the curtains around ###CHAR68###'s four-poster ###CHAR68### watched snow starting to drift past the tower window and wondered ... Could ###CHAR68### be a descendant of Salazar Slithering? 
He didn't know anything about his father's family, after all. 
The Dursleys had always forbidden questions about his wizarding relatives. 
Quietly, ###CHAR68### tried to say something in Parseltongue. 
The words wouldn't come. 
It seemed ###CHAR68### had to be face-to-face with a snake to do it. 
But I'm in Gryffindor, ###CHAR68### thought. 
The Sorting Hat wouldn't have put me in here if I had Slytherin blood... Ah, said a nasty little voice in ###CHAR68###'s brain, but the Sorting Hat wanted to put you in Slytherin, don't you remember? 
###CHAR68### turned over. 
###CHAR68###'d see ###CHAR100### the next day in Herbology and ###CHAR100###'d explain that ###CHAR100###'d been calling the snake off, not egging it on, which -LRB-###CHAR100### thought angrily, pummeling ###CHAR100###'s pillow-RRB- any fool should have realized. 
By next morning, however, the snow that had begun in the night had turned into a blizzard so thick that the last Herbology lesson of the term was canceled: Professor Sprout wanted to fit socks and scarves on the Mandrakes, a tricky operation ###CHAR100### would entrust to no one else, now that it was so important for the Mandrakes to grow quickly and revive ###CHAR34### and ###CHAR66### . 
###CHAR68### fretted about this next to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, while ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### used their time off to play a game of wizard chess. 
###DIALOGUE###``For heaven's sake, ###CHAR68###,'' said ###CHAR25###, exasperated, as one of ###CHAR68###'s bishops wrestled ###CHAR25###'s knight off ###CHAR68###'s horse and dragged ###CHAR68### off the board. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Go and find ###CHAR100### if it's so important to you.'' 
So ###CHAR68### got up and left through the portrait hole, wondering where ###CHAR100### might be. 
The castle was darker than it usually was in daytime because of the thick, swirling gray snow at every window. 
Shivering, ###CHAR68### walked past classrooms where lessons were taking place, catching snatches of what was happening within. 
Professor ###CHAR96### was shouting at someone who, by the sound of it, had turned his friend into a badger. 
Resisting the urge to take a look, ###CHAR68### walked on by, thinking that ###CHAR100### might be using ###CHAR68###'s free time to catch up on some work, and deciding to check the library first. 
A group of the Hufliepuffs who should have been in Herbology were indeed sitting at the back of the library, but they didn't seem to be working. 
Between the long lines of high bookshelves, ###CHAR68### could see that their heads were close together and they were having what looked like an absorbing conversation. 
###CHAR68### couldn't see whether ###CHAR100### was among them. 
###CHAR100### was walking toward them when something of what they were saying met ###CHAR100###'s ears, and ###CHAR100### paused to listen, hidden in the Invisibility section. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``So anyway,'' a stout boy was saying, ``I told ###CHAR100### to hide up in our dormitory. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I mean to say, if ###CHAR54###'s marked ###CHAR54### down as ###CHAR54###'s next victim, it's best if ###CHAR54### keeps a low profile for a while. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Of course, ###CHAR100###'s been waiting for something like this to happen ever since ###CHAR100### let slip to ###CHAR54### ###CHAR100### was Muggle-born. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR100### actually told ###CHAR100### 'd been down for ###CHAR90###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###That's not the kind of thing you bandy about with ###CHAR45###'s heir on the loose, is it?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You definitely think it is ###CHAR54###, then, ###CHAR40###?'' 
said a girl with blonde pigtails anxiously. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR36###,'' said the stout boy solemnly, ``###CHAR40###'s a Parselmouth. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Everyone knows that's the mark of a Dark wizard. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Have you ever heard of a decent one who could talk to snakes? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They called Slytherin himself Serpent-tongue.'' 
###DIALOGUE###There was some heavy murmuring at this, and ###CHAR40### went on, ``Remember what was written on the wall? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Enemies of the Heir, Beware. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR54### had some sort of run-in with Filch. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Next thing we know, ###CHAR86###'s cat's attacked. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###That first year, ###CHAR66###, was annoying ###CHAR54### at the Quidditch match, taking pictures of ###CHAR54### while ###CHAR54### was lying in the mud. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Next thing we know - ###CHAR66###'s been attacked.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR66### always seems so nice, though,'' said ###CHAR36### uncertainly, ``and, well, ###CHAR66###'s the one who made You-Know-Who disappear. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR66### can't be all bad, can ###CHAR66###?'' 
###CHAR40### lowered ###CHAR40###'s voice mysteriously, the Hufflepuffs bent closer, and ###CHAR68### edged nearer so that ###CHAR68### could catch ###CHAR40###'s words. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``No one knows how ###CHAR66### survived that attack by You-Know-Who. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I mean to say, ###CHAR66### was only a baby when it happened. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR66### should have been blasted into smithereens. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Only a really powerful Dark wizard could have survived a curse like that.'' 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR40### dropped ###CHAR40###'s voice until it was barely more than a whisper, and said, ``That's probably why You- ###CHAR37### wanted to kill him in the first place. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Didn't want another Dark Lord competing with him. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I wonder what other powers ###CHAR54###'s been hiding?'' 
###CHAR68### couldn't take anymore. 
Clearing ###CHAR68###'s throat loudly, ###CHAR68### stepped out from behind the bookshelves. 
If ###CHAR68### hadn't been feeling so angry, ###CHAR68### would have found the sight that greeted ###CHAR68### funny: Every one of the Hufflepuffs looked as though they had been Petrified by the sight of ###CHAR68###, and the color was draining out of ###CHAR40###'s face. 
###DIALOGUE###``Hello,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I'm looking for ###CHAR100### .'' 
The Hufepuffs' worst fears had clearly been confirmed. 
They all looked fearfully at ###CHAR40###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What do you want with ###CHAR100###?'' 
said ###CHAR40### in a quavering voice. 
###DIALOGUE###``I wanted to tell ###CHAR100### what really happened with that snake at the Dueling Club,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR40### bit ###CHAR40###'s white lips and then, taking a deep breath, said, ``We were all there. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###We saw what happened.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Then you noticed that after I spoke to it, the snake backed off?'' 
said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``All I saw,'' said ###CHAR40### stubbornly, though ###CHAR40### was trembling as ###CHAR40### spoke, ``was you speaking Parseltongue and chasing the snake toward ###CHAR100###. '' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I didn't chase it at ###CHAR100###!'' 
###CHAR68### said, ###CHAR68###'s voice shaking with anger. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It didn't even touch ###CHAR100###!'' 
###DIALOGUE###``It was a very near miss,'' said ###CHAR40###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``And in case you're getting ideas,'' ###CHAR40### added hastily, ``I might tell you that you can trace my family back through nine generations of witches and warlocks and my blood's as pure as anyone's, so -'' - cc I don't care what sort of blood you've got!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68### fiercely. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Why would I want to attack Muggle-borns?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I've heard you hate those Muggles you live with,'' said ###CHAR40### swiftly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It's not possible to live with the ###CHAR88### and not hate them,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Id like to see you try it.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### turned on ###CHAR68###'s heel and stormed out of the library, earning himself a reproving glare from ###CHAR16### , who was polishing the gilded cover of a large spellbook. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### blundered up the corridor, barely noticing where ###CHAR68### was going, ###CHAR68### was in such a fury. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The result was that ###CHAR68### walked into something very large and solid, which knocked ###CHAR68### backward onto the floor. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Oh, hello, ###CHAR22###,'' ###CHAR68### said, looking up. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR22###'s face was entirely hidden by a woolly, snow-covered balaclava, but it couldn't possibly be anyone else, as ###CHAR68### filled most of the corridor in ###CHAR68###'s moleskin overcoat. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###A dead rooster was hanging from one of ###CHAR68###'s massive, gloved hands. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``All righ', ###CHAR68###?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### said, pulling up the balaclava so ###CHAR68### could speak. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Why aren't yeh in class?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Canceled,'' said ###CHAR68###, getting up. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What're you doing in here?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR22### held up the limp rooster. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Second one killed this term,'' ###CHAR68### explained. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It's either foxes or a Blood-Suckin Bugbear, an' I need the Headmaster's permission ter put a charm around the hen coop.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### peered more closely at Harry from under his thick, snowflecked eyebrows. 
###DIALOGUE###``Yeh sure yeh're all righ'? 
###DIALOGUE###Yeh look all hot an' bothered -'' ###CHAR68### couldn't bring himself to repeat what ###CHAR40### and the rest of the Hufflepuffs had been saying about ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It's nothing,'' ###CHAR68### said. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Id better get going, ###CHAR22###, it's Transfiguration next and I've got to pick up my books.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### walked off, ###CHAR68###'s mind still full of what ###CHAR40### had said about ###CHAR40###. 
###DIALOGUE###``###CHAR100###'s been waiting for something like this to happen ever since ###CHAR100### let slip to ###CHAR54### ###CHAR100### was Muggle-born ... ###CHAR68### stamped up the stairs and turned along another corridor, which was particularly dark; the torches had been extinguished by a strong, icy draft that was blowing through a loose windowpane. 
###CHAR68### was halfway down the passage when ###CHAR68### tripped headlong over something lying on the floor. 
###CHAR68### turned to squint at what ###CHAR68###'d fallen over and felt as though ###CHAR68###'s stomach had dissolved. 
###CHAR100### was lying on the floor, rigid and cold, a look of shock frozen on ###CHAR100###'s face, ###CHAR100###'s eyes staring blankly at the ceiling. 
And that wasn't all. 
Next to ###CHAR100### was another figure, the strangest sight ###CHAR68### had ever seen. 
It was Nearly Headless ###CHAR29###, no longer pearly-white and transparent, but black and smoky, floating immobile and horizontal, six inches off the floor. 
###CHAR68###'s head was half off and ###CHAR68###'s face wore an expression of shock identical to ###CHAR100###'s. 
###CHAR68### got to ###CHAR68###'s feet, ###CHAR68###'s breathing fast and shallow, ###CHAR68###'s heart doing a kind of drumroll against ###CHAR68###'s ribs. 
###CHAR68### looked wildly up and down the deserted corridor and saw a line of spiders scuttling as fast as they could away from the bodies. 
The only sounds were the muffled voices of teachers from the classes on either side. 
###CHAR68### could run, and no one would ever know ###CHAR68### had been there. 
But ###CHAR68### couldn't just leave them lying here ... ###CHAR68### had to get help ... Would anyone believe ###CHAR68### hadn't had anything to do with this? 
As ###CHAR68### stood there, panicking, a door right next to ###CHAR68### opened with a bang. 
Peeves the Poltergeist came shooting out. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Why, it's potty wee ###CHAR54###!'' 
cackled Peeves, knocking ###CHAR68###'s glasses askew as ###CHAR68### bounced past ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What's ###CHAR54### up to? 
###DIALOGUE###Why's ###CHAR54### lurking -'' Peeves stopped, halfway through a midair somersault. 
Upside down, ###CHAR68### spotted ###CHAR100### and Nearly Headless ###CHAR29###. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR29### flipped the right way up, filled ###CHAR29###'s lungs and, before ###CHAR68### could stop ###CHAR68###, screamed, ``ATTACK! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###ATTACK! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###ANOTHER ATTACK! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###NO MORTAL OR GHOST IS SAFE! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###RUN FOR YOUR LIVES! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###ATTAAAACK!'' 
Crash - crash - crash - door after door flew open along the corridor and people flooded out. 
For several long minutes, there was a scene of such confusion that ###CHAR100### was in danger of being squashed and people kept standing in Nearly Headless ###CHAR29###. 
###CHAR68### found himself pinned against the wall as the teachers shouted for quiet. 
Professor ###CHAR96### came running, followed by ###CHAR68###'s own class, one of whom still had black-and-white-striped hair. 
###CHAR68### used ###CHAR68###'s wand to set off aloud bang, which restored silence, and ordered everyone back into their classes. 
No sooner had the scene cleared somewhat than Ernie the Hufflepuff arrived, panting, on the scene. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Caught in the act!'' 
###CHAR40### yelled, ###CHAR40###'s face stark white, pointing ###CHAR40###'s finger dramatically at ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``That will do, ###CHAR40###!'' 
said Professor ###CHAR96### sharply. 
Peeves was bobbing overhead, now grinning wickedly, surveying the scene; Peeves always loved chaos. 
###DIALOGUE###As the teachers bent over ###CHAR100### and Nearly Headless ###CHAR29###, examining them, ###CHAR24### broke into song: ``Oh, ###CHAR54###, you rotter, oh, what have you done, You're killing off' students, you think it's good fun -'' ``That's enough Peeves!'' 
barked Professor ###CHAR96###, and Peeves zoomed away backward, with his tongue out at ###CHAR68###. 
###CHAR100### was carried up to the hospital wing by Professor ###CHAR2### and Professor Sinistra of the Astronomy department, but nobody seemed to know what to do for Nearly Headless ###CHAR29###. 
In the end, Professor ###CHAR96### conjured a large fan out of thin air, which ###CHAR24### gave to ###CHAR40### with instructions to waft Nearly Headless ###CHAR29### up the stairs. 
This ###CHAR40### did, fanning ###CHAR29### along like a silent black hovercraft. 
This left ###CHAR68### and Professor ###CHAR96### alone together. 
###DIALOGUE###``This way, ###CHAR54###,'' ###CHAR24### said. 
###DIALOGUE###``Professor,'' said ###CHAR68### at once, ``I swear I didn't -'' ``This is out of my hands, ###CHAR54###,'' said Professor ###CHAR96### curtly. 
They marched in silence around a corner and ###CHAR24### stopped before a large and extremely ugly stone gargoyle. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Lemon drop!'' 
###CHAR24### said. 
This was evidently a password, because the gargoyle sprang suddenly to life and hopped aside as the wall behind him split in two. 
Even full of dread for what was coming, ###CHAR68### couldn't fail to be amazed. 
Behind the wall was a spiral staircase that was moving smoothly upward, like an escalator. 
As ###CHAR68### and Professor ###CHAR96### stepped onto it, ###CHAR68### heard the wall thud closed behind them. 
They rose upward in circles, higher and higher, until at last, slightly dizzy, ###CHAR68### saw a gleaming oak door ahead, with a brass knocker in the shape of a griffin. 
###CHAR68### knew now where ###CHAR68### was being taken. 
This must be where ###CHAR94### lived.
THE POLYJUICE POTION
They stepped off the stone staircase at the top, and Professor ###CHAR96### rapped on the door. 
It opened silently and they entered. 
Professor ###CHAR96### told ###CHAR68### to wait and left him there, alone. 
Harry looked around. 
One thing was certain: of all the teachers' offices ###CHAR68### had visited so far this year, ###CHAR94###'s was by far the most interesting. 
If ###CHAR68### hadn't been scared out of ###CHAR68###'s wits that ###CHAR68### was about to be thrown out of school, ###CHAR68### would have been very pleased to have a chance to look around it. 
It was a large and beautiful circular room, full of funny little noises. 
A number of curious silver instruments stood on spindlelegged tables, whirring and emitting little puffs of smoke. 
The walls were covered with portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses, all of whom were snoozing gently in their frames. 
There was also an enormous, claw-footed desk, and, sitting on a shelf behind it, a shabby, tattered wizard's hat - the Sorting Hat. 
###CHAR68### hesitated. 
###CHAR68### cast a wary eye around the sleeping witches and wizards on the walls. 
Surely it couldn't hurt if ###CHAR68### took the hat down and tried it on again? 
Just to see ... just to make sure it had put ###CHAR68### in the right House ###CHAR68### walked quietly around the desk, lifted the hat from its shelf, and lowered it slowly onto ###CHAR68###'s head. 
It was much too large and slipped down over ###CHAR68###'s eyes, just as it had done the last time ###CHAR68###'d put it on. 
###CHAR68### stared at the black inside of the hat, waiting. 
###DIALOGUE###Then a small voice said in ###CHAR68###'s ear, ``Bee in your bonnet, ###CHAR54### ?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Er, yes,'' ###CHAR68### muttered. 
###DIALOGUE###``Er - sorry to bother you - I wanted to ask - '' ``You've been wondering whether I put you in the right ###CHAR42###,'' said the hat smartly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Yes ... you were particularly difficult to place. 
###DIALOGUE###But I stand by what I said before'' - ###CHAR68###'s heart leapt - ``you would have done well in Slytherin -'' ###CHAR68###'s stomach plummeted. 
###CHAR68### grabbed the point of the hat and pulled it off. 
It hung limply in ###CHAR68###'s hand, grubby and faded. 
###CHAR68### pushed it back onto its shelf, feeling sick. 
###DIALOGUE###``You're wrong,'' ###CHAR68### said aloud to the still and silent hat. 
It didn't move. 
###CHAR68### backed away, watching it. 
Then a strange, gagging noise behind ###CHAR68### made ###CHAR68### wheel around. 
###CHAR68### wasn't alone after all. 
Standing on a golden perch behind the door was a decrepit-looking bird that resembled a half-plucked turkey. 
###CHAR68### stared at it and the bird looked balefully back, making its gagging noise again. 
###CHAR68### thought it looked very ill. 
Its eyes were dull and, even as ###CHAR68### watched, a couple more feathers fell out of its tail. 
###CHAR68### was just thinking that all ###CHAR68### needed was for ###CHAR94###'s pet bird to die while ###CHAR68### was alone in the office with it, when the bird burst into flames. 
###CHAR68### yelled in shock and backed away into the desk. 
###CHAR68### looked feverishly around in case there was a glass of water somewhere but couldn't see one; the bird, meanwhile, had become a fireball; it gave one loud shriek and next second there was nothing but a smouldering pile of ash on the floor. 
The office door opened. 
###CHAR94### came in, looking very somber. 
###DIALOGUE###``Professor,'' ###CHAR68### gasped. 
###DIALOGUE###``Your bird - I couldn't do anything - he just caught fire -'' To ###CHAR68###'s astonishment, ###CHAR94### smiled. 
###DIALOGUE###``About time, too,'' ###CHAR68### said. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``He's been looking dreadful for days; I've been telling him to get a move on.'' 
###CHAR68### chuckled at the stunned look on ###CHAR68###'s face. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Fawkes is a phoenix, ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Phoenixes burst into flame when it is time for them to die and are reborn from the ashes. 
###DIALOGUE###Watch ###CHAR68### ...'' ###CHAR68### looked down in time to see a tiny, wrinkled, newborn bird poke its head out of the ashes. 
It was quite as ugly as the old one. 
###DIALOGUE###``It's a shame you had to see ###CHAR68### on a Burning Day,'' said ###CHAR94###, seating himself behind ###CHAR94###'s desk. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR68###'s really very handsome most of the time, wonderful red and gold plumage. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Fascinating creatures, phoenixes. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They can carry immensely heavy loads, their tears have healing powers, and they make highly faithful pets.'' 
In the shock of Fawkes catching fire, ###CHAR68### had forgotten what ###CHAR68### was there for, but it all came back to ###CHAR68### as ###CHAR94### settled himself in the high chair behind the desk and fixed ###CHAR68### with ###CHAR68###'s penetrating, light-blue stare. 
Before ###CHAR94### could speak another word, however, the door of the office flew open with an almighty bang and ###CHAR22### burst in, a wild look in ###CHAR68###'s eyes, ###CHAR68###'s balaclava perched on top of ###CHAR68###'s shaggy black head and the dead rooster still swinging from ###CHAR68###'s hand. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It wasn' Harry, Professor ###CHAR94###!'' 
said ###CHAR22### urgently. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I was talkin' ter him seconds before that kid was found, he never had time, sir - '' ###CHAR94### tried to say something, but ###CHAR22### went ranting on, waving the rooster around in ###CHAR94###'s agitation, sending feathers everywhere. ''
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###- it can't've bin ###CHAR94###, I'll swear it in front o' the Ministry o' Magic if I have to -'' ``Hagrid, I -'' ''- yeh've got the wrong boy, sir, I know ###CHAR68### never =' ``Hagrid!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR94### loudly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I do not think that ###CHAR68### attacked those people.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Oh,'' said ###CHAR22###, the rooster falling limply at ###CHAR68###'s side. 
###DIALOGUE###``Right. 
###DIALOGUE###I'll wait outside then, Headmaster.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###And ###CHAR68### stomped out looking embarrassed. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You don't think it was me, Professor?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### repeated hopefully as ###CHAR94### brushed rooster feathers off ###CHAR94###'s desk. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``No, ###CHAR68###, I don't,'' said ###CHAR94###, though ###CHAR94###'s face was somber again. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But I still want to talk to you.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### waited nervously while ###CHAR94### considered ###CHAR68###, the tips of ###CHAR94###'s long fingers together. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I must ask you, ###CHAR68###, whether there is anything you'd like to tell me,'' ###CHAR94### said gently. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Anything at all.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### didn't know what to say. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### thought of Malfoy shouting, ``You'll be next, Mudbloods!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###and of the Polyjuice Potion simmering away in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Then ###CHAR68### thought of the disembodied voice ###CHAR68### had heard twice and remembered what ###CHAR68### had said: ``Hearing voices no one else can hear isn't a good sign, even in the wizarding world.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### thought, too, about what everyone was saying about ###CHAR68###, and ###CHAR68###'s growing dread that ###CHAR68### was somehow connected with ###CHAR45### ... ``No,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``There isn't anything, Professor ...'' The double attack on ###CHAR100### and Nearly Headless ###CHAR29### turned what had hitherto been nervousness into real panic. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Curiously, it was Nearly Headless ###CHAR29###'s fate that seemed to worry people most. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###What could possibly do that to a ghost? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###people asked each other; what terrible power could harm someone who was already dead? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There was almost a stampede to book seats on the ###CHAR62### so that students could go home for Christmas. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``At this rate, we'll be the only ones left,'' ###CHAR68### told ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25###. 
###DIALOGUE###``Us, ###CHAR50###, ###CHAR44###, and Goyle. 
###DIALOGUE###What a jolly holiday it's going to be.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR44### and ###CHAR6###, who always did whatever ###CHAR50### did, had signed up to stay over the holidays, too. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###But ###CHAR68### was glad that most people were leaving. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### was tired of people skirting around ###CHAR68### in the corridors, as though ###CHAR68### was about to sprout fangs or spit poison; tired of all the muttering, pointing, and hissing as ###CHAR68### passed. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR55### and ###CHAR19###, however, found all this very funny. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They went out of their way to march ahead of ###CHAR68### down the corridors, shouting, ``Make way for the Heir of Slytherin, seriously evil wizard coming through ...'' ###CHAR70### was deeply disapproving of this behavior. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It is not a laughing matter,'' ###CHAR68### said coldly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Oh, get out of the way, ###CHAR70###,'' said ###CHAR55###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR68###'s in a hurry.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Yeah, ###CHAR68###'s off to the Chamber of Secrets for a cup of tea with ###CHAR68###'s fanged servant,'' said ###CHAR19###, chortling. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR76### didn't find it amusing either. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Oh, don't,'' ###CHAR76### wailed every time ###CHAR55### asked ###CHAR68### loudly who ###CHAR68### was planning to attack next, or when ###CHAR19### pretended to ward ###CHAR68### off with a large clove of garlic when they met. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### didn't mind; it made ###CHAR68### feel better that ###CHAR55### and ###CHAR19###, at least, thought the idea of ###CHAR55###'s being Slytherin's heir was quite ludicrous. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###But their antics seemed to be aggravating ###CHAR0### , who looked increasingly sour each time ###CHAR0### saw them at it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It's because ###CHAR68###'s bursting to say it's really ###CHAR68###,'' said ###CHAR68### knowingly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You know how ###CHAR68### hates anyone beating ###CHAR68### at anything, and you're getting all the credit for ###CHAR68###'s dirty work.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Not for long,'' said ###CHAR25### in a satisfied tone. 
###DIALOGUE###``The Polyjuice Potion's nearly ready. 
###DIALOGUE###We'll be getting the truth out of ###CHAR68### any day now.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###At last the term ended, and a silence deep as the snow on the grounds descended on the castle. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### found it peaceful, rather than gloomy, and enjoyed the fact that ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR25###, and the Weasleys had the run of Gryffindor Tower, which meant they could play Exploding Snap loudly without bothering anyone, and practice dueling in private. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR55###, ###CHAR19###, and ###CHAR76### had chosen to stay at school rather than visit ###CHAR13### in Egypt with Mr. and ###CHAR83### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR70###, who disapproved of what ###CHAR70### termed their childish behavior, didn't spend much time in the Gryffindor common room. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR70### had already told them pompously that ###CHAR70### was only staying over Christmas because it was ###CHAR70###'s duty as a prefect to support the teachers during this troubled time. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Christmas morning dawned, cold and white. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### and ###CHAR68###, the only ones left in their dormitory, were woken very early by ###CHAR25###, who burst in, fully dressed and carrying presents for them both. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Wake up,'' ###CHAR25### said loudly, pulling back the curtains at the window. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR25### - you're not supposed to be in here -'' said ###CHAR68###, shielding ###CHAR68###'s eyes against the light. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Merry Christmas to you, too,'' said ###CHAR25###, throwing ###CHAR68### present. 
###DIALOGUE###``I've been up for nearly an hour, adding more lacewings to the potion. 
###DIALOGUE###It's ready.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### sat up, suddenly wide awake. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Are you sure?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Positive,'' said ###CHAR25###, shifting Scabbers the rat so that ###CHAR25### could sit down on the end of ###CHAR68###'s four-poster. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``If we're going to do it, I say it should be tonight.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###At that moment, ###CHAR33### swooped into the room, carrying a very small package in ###CHAR33###'s beak. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Hello,'' said ###CHAR68### happily as ###CHAR33### landed on ###CHAR68###'s bed. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Are you speaking to me again?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR33### nibbled ###CHAR68###'s ear in an affectionate sort of way, which was a far better present than the one that ###CHAR33### had brought ###CHAR68###, which turned out to be from the ###CHAR88###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They had sent ###CHAR68### a toothpick and a note telling ###CHAR68### to find out whether ###CHAR68###'d be able to stay at Hogwarts for the summer vacation, too. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The rest of ###CHAR68###'s Christmas presents were far more satisfactory. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR22### had sent ###CHAR68### a large tin of treacle fudge, which ###CHAR68### decided to soften by the fire before eating; ###CHAR68### had given ###CHAR68### a book called Flying with the Cannons, a book of interesting facts about ###CHAR68###'s favorite Quidditch team, and ###CHAR25### had bought ###CHAR68### a luxury eagle-feather quill. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### opened the last present to find a new, hand-knitted sweater from ###CHAR83### and a large plum cake. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### read ###CHAR83###'s card with a fresh surge of guilt, thinking about ###CHAR84### 's car -LRB-which hadn't been seen since its crash with the Whomping Willow-RRB-, and the bout of rule-breaking ###CHAR84### and ###CHAR68### were planning next. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###No one, not even someone dreading taking Polyjuice Potion later, could fail to enjoy Christmas dinner at Hogwarts. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The Great Hall looked magnificent. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Not only were there a dozen frost-covered Christmas trees and thick streamers of holly and mistletoe crisscrossing the ceiling, but enchanted snow was falling, warm and dry, from the ceiling. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR94### led them in a few of ###CHAR94###'s favorite carols, ###CHAR22### booming more and more loudly with every goblet of eggnog ###CHAR94### consumed. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR70###, who hadn't noticed that ###CHAR55### had bewitched ###CHAR55###'s prefect badge so that it now read ``Pinhead,'' kept asking them all what they were sniggering at. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### didn't even care that ###CHAR0### was making loud, snide remarks about ###CHAR68###'s new sweater from the Slytherin table. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###With a bit of luck, ###CHAR50### would be getting ###CHAR50###'s comeuppance in a few hours' time. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### had barely finished their third helpings of Christmas pudding when ###CHAR25### ushered them out of the hall to finalize their plans for the evening. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We still need a bit of the people you're changing into,'' said Hermione matter-of-facdy, as though she were sending them to the supermarket for laundry detergent. 
###DIALOGUE###``And obviously, it'll be best if you can get something of ###CHAR44###'s and ###CHAR6###'s; they're ###CHAR30### best friends, ###CHAR44###'ll tell them anything. 
And we also need to make sure the real ###CHAR44### and ###CHAR6### can't burst in on us while we're interrogating ###CHAR44###. 
###DIALOGUE###``I've got it all worked out,'' she went on smoothly, ignoring ###CHAR68###'s and ###CHAR68###'s stupefied faces. 
She held up two plump chocolate cakes. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I've filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###All you have to do is make sure ###CHAR44### and ###CHAR6### find them. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###You know how greedy they are, they're bound to eat them. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Once they're asleep, pull out a few of their hairs and hide them in a broom closet.'' 
###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### looked incredulously at each other. 
###DIALOGUE###``Hermione, I don't think -'' ``That could go seriously wrong -'' But ###CHAR25### had a steely glint in ###CHAR25###'s eye not unlike the one Professor ###CHAR96### sometimes had. 
###DIALOGUE###``The potion will be useless without ###CHAR44###'s and ###CHAR6###'s hair,'' ###CHAR25### said sternly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You do want to investigate ###CHAR50###, don't you?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Oh, all right, all right,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But what about you? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Whose hair are you ripping out?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I've already got mine!'' 
said ###CHAR25### brightly, pulling a tiny bottle out of ###CHAR25###'s pocket and showing them the single hair inside it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Remember ###CHAR93### wrestling with me at the Dueling Club? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR93### left this on my robes when ###CHAR93### was trying to strangle me! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###And ###CHAR93###'s gone home for Christmas - so I'll just have to tell the Slytherins I've decided to come back.'' 
When ###CHAR25### had bustled off to check on the Polyjuice Potion again, ###CHAR68### turned to ###CHAR68### with a doom-laden expression. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go wrong?'' 
But to ###CHAR68###'s and ###CHAR68###'s utter amazement, stage one of the operation went just as smoothly as ###CHAR25### had said. 
They lurked in the deserted entrance hall after Christmas tea, waiting for ###CHAR44### and ###CHAR6### who had remained alone at the Slytherin table, shoveling down fourth helpings of trifle. 
###CHAR68### had perched the chocolate cakes on the end of the banisters. 
When they spotted ###CHAR44### and ###CHAR6### coming out of the Great Hall, ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### hid quickly behind a suit of armor next to the front door. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``How thick can you get?'' 
###CHAR68### whispered ecstatically as ###CHAR44### gleefully pointed out the cakes to Goyle and grabbed them. 
Grinning stupidly, they stuffed the cakes whole into their large mouths. 
For a moment, both of them chewed greedily, looks of triumph on their faces. 
Then, without the smallest change of expression, they both keeled over backward onto the floor. 
By far the hardest part was hiding them in the closet across the hall. 
Once they were safely stowed among the buckets and mops, ###CHAR68### yanked out a couple of the bristles that covered ###CHAR6###'s fore head and ###CHAR68### pulled out several of ###CHAR44###'s hairs. 
They also stole their shoes, because their own were far too small for ###CHAR44###- and Goyle-size feet. 
Then, still stunned at what they had just done, they sprinted up to Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. 
They could hardly see for the thick black smoke issuing from the stall in which ###CHAR25### was stirring the cauldron. 
Pulling their robes up over their faces, ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### knocked softly on the door. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Hermione?'' 
They heard the scrape of the lock and ###CHAR25### emerged, shinyfaced and looking anxious. 
Behind ###CHAR25###'s they heard the gloop gloop of the bubbling, glutinous potion. 
Three glass tumblers stood ready on the toilet seat. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Did you get them?'' 
###CHAR25### asked breathlessly. 
###CHAR68### showed ###CHAR25###'s Goyle's hair. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Good. 
###DIALOGUE###And I sneaked these spare robes out of the laundry,'' ###CHAR25### said, holding up a small sack. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You'll need bigger sizes once you're Crabbe and Goyle.'' 
The three of them stared into the cauldron. 
Close up, the potion looked like thick, dark mud, bubbling sluggishly. 
###DIALOGUE###``I'm sure I've done everything right,'' said ###CHAR25###, nervously rereading the splotched page of ###CHAR77### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It looks like the book says it should ... once we've drunk it, we'll have exactly an hour before we change back into ourselves.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Now what?'' 
###CHAR68### whispered. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We separate it into three glasses and add the hairs.'' 
###CHAR25### ladled large dollops of the potion into each of the glasses. 
Then, ###CHAR25###'s hand trembling, ###CHAR25### shook ###CHAR93### 's hair out of its bottle into the first glass. 
The potion hissed loudly like a boiling kettle and frothed madly. 
A second later, it had turned a sick sort of yellow. 
###DIALOGUE###``Urgh - essence of ###CHAR93### ,'' said ###CHAR68###, eyeing it with loathing. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Bet it tastes disgusting.'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Add yours, then,'' said ###CHAR25###. 
###CHAR68### dropped ###CHAR6###'s hair into the middle glass and ###CHAR68### put ###CHAR44###'s into the last one. 
Both glasses hissed and frothed: ###CHAR6###'s turned the khaki color of a booger, ###CHAR44###'s a dark, murky brown. 
###DIALOGUE###``Hang on,'' said ###CHAR68### as ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### reached for their glasses. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We'd better not all drink them in here ... Once we turn into ###CHAR44### and Goyle we won't fit. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###And ###CHAR93### 's no pixie. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Good thinking,'' said ###CHAR68###, unlocking the door. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We'll take separate stalls.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Careful not to spill a drop of ###CHAR68###'s Polyjuice Potion, ###CHAR68### slipped into the middle stall. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Ready?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### called. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Ready,'' came ###CHAR68###'s and ###CHAR25###'s voices. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``One - two - three -'' Pinching ###CHAR68###'s nose, ###CHAR68### drank the potion down in two large gulps. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It tasted like overcooked cabbage. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Immediately, ###CHAR68###'s insides started writhing as though ###CHAR68###'d just swallowed live snakes - doubled up, ###CHAR68### wondered whether ###CHAR68### was going to be sick - then a burning sensation spread rapidly from ###CHAR68###'s stomach to the very ends of ###CHAR68###'s fingers and toes - next, bringing ###CHAR68### gasping to all fours, came a horrible melting feeling, as the skin all over ###CHAR68###'s body bubbled like hot wax - and before ###CHAR68###'s eyes, ###CHAR68###'s hands began to grow, the fingers thickened, the nails broadened, the knuckles were bulging like bolts -###CHAR68###'s shoulders stretched painfully and a prickling on ###CHAR68###'s forehead told ###CHAR68### that hair was creeping down toward ###CHAR68###'s eyebrows - ###CHAR68###'s robes ripped as ###CHAR68###'s chest expanded like a barrel bursting its hoops - ###CHAR68###'s feet were agony in shoes four sizes too small As suddenly as it had started, everything stopped. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### lay facedown on the stone-cold floor, listening to Myrtle gurgling morosely in the end toilet. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###With difficulty, ###CHAR68### kicked off ###CHAR68###'s shoes and stood up. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###So this was what it felt like, being Goyle. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###'s large hand trembling, ###CHAR68### pulled off ###CHAR68###'s old robes, which were hanging a foot above ###CHAR68###'s ankles, pulled on the spare ones, and laced up ###CHAR6###'s boatlike shoes. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### reached up to brush ###CHAR68###'s hair out of ###CHAR68###'s eyes and met only the short growth of wiry bristles, low on ###CHAR68###'s forehead. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Then ###CHAR68### realized that ###CHAR68###'s glasses were clouding ###CHAR68###'s eyes because ###CHAR6### obviously didn't need them - ###CHAR68### took them off and called, ``Are you two okay?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR6###'s low rasp of a voice issued from ###CHAR68###'s mouth. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Yeah,'' came the deep grunt of Crabbe from his right. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### unlocked ###CHAR68###'s door and stepped in front of the cracked mirror. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR6### stared back at ###CHAR68### out of dull, deepset eyes. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### scratched ###CHAR68###'s ear. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###So did Goyle. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###'s door opened. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They stared at each other. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Except that ###CHAR68### looked pale and shocked, ###CHAR68### was indistinguishable from Crabbe, from the pudding-bowl haircut to the long, gorilla arms. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``This is unbelievable,'' said ###CHAR68###, approaching the mirror and prodding Crabbe's flat nose. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Unbelievable. '' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We'd better get going,'' said ###CHAR68###, loosening the watch that was cutting into ###CHAR6###'s thick wrist. 
###DIALOGUE###``We've still got to find out where the Slytherin common room is. 
###DIALOGUE###I only hope we can find someone to follow...'' ###CHAR68###, who had been gazing at ###CHAR68###, said, ``You don't know how bizarre it is to see Goyle thinking.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### banged on ###CHAR25###'s door. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``C'mon, we need to go -'' A high-pitched voice answered ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``I - I don't think I'm going to come after all. 
You go on without me. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR25###, we know ###CHAR93### 's ugly, no one's going to know it's you -'' ``No - really - I don't think I'll come. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###You two hurry up, you re wasting time ###CHAR68### looked at ###CHAR68###, bewildered. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``That looks more like Goyle,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``That's how ###CHAR68### looks every time a teacher asks ###CHAR68### a question.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Hermione, are you okay?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68### through the door. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Fine - I'm fine - go on -'' ###CHAR68### looked at ###CHAR68###'s watch. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Five of their precious sixty minutes had already passed. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We'll meet you back here, all right?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### said. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### opened the door of the bathroom carefully, checked that the coast was clear, and set off. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Don't swing your arms like that,'' ###CHAR68### muttered to ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Eh?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Crabbe holds them sort of stiff ...'' ``How's this?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Yeah, that's better ...'' They went down the marble staircase. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###All they needed now was a Slytherin that they could follow to the Slytherin common room, but there was nobody around. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Any ideas?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###muttered ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``The Slytherins always come up to breakfast from over there,'' said ###CHAR68###, nodding at the entrance to the dungeons. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The words had barely left ###CHAR68###'s mouth when a girl with long, curly hair emerged from the entrance. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Excuse me,'' said ###CHAR68###, hurrying up to her. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We've forgotten the way to our common room.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I beg your pardon?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said the girl stiffly. 
###DIALOGUE###``Our common room? 
###DIALOGUE###I'm a Ravenclaw.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###She walked away, looking suspiciously back at them. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### hurried down the stone steps into the darkness, their footsteps echoing particularly loudly as ###CHAR44###'s and Goyle's huge feet hit the floor, feeling that this wasn't going to be as easy as they had hoped. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The labyrinthine passages were deserted. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They walked deeper and deeper under the school, constantly checking their watches to see how much time they had left. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###After a quarter of an hour, just when they were getting desperate, they heard a sudden movement ahead. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Ha!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68### excitedly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``There's one of them now!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The figure was emerging from a side room. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###As they hurried nearer, however, their hearts sank. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It wasn't a Slytherin, it was ###CHAR70###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What're you doing down here?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68### in surprise. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR70### looked affronted. 
###DIALOGUE###``That,'' ###CHAR68### said stiffly, ``is none of your business. 
###DIALOGUE###It's ###CHAR44###, isn't it?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Wh - oh, yeah,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Well, get off to your dormitories,'' said ###CHAR70### sternly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It's not safe to go wandering around dark corridors these days.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You are,'' ###CHAR68### pointed out. 
###DIALOGUE###``I,'' said ###CHAR70###, drawing himself up, ``am a prefect. 
###DIALOGUE###Nothing's about to attack me.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###A voice suddenly echoed behind ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR0### was strolling toward them, and for the first time in ###CHAR68###'s life, ###CHAR68### was pleased to see ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``There you are,'' ###CHAR68### drawled, looking at them. 
###DIALOGUE###``Have you two been pigging out in the Great Hall all this time? 
###DIALOGUE###I've been looking for you; I want to show you something really funny.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR50### glanced witheringly at Percy. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``And what're you doing down here, ###CHAR55###?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###he sneered. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR70### looked outraged. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You want to show a bit more respect to a school prefect!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR70### said. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I don't like your attitude!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR50### sneered and motioned for ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### to follow ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### almost said something apologetic to ###CHAR70### but caught himself just in time. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR70### and ###CHAR68### hurried after ###CHAR50###, who said as they turned into the next passage, ``That Peter Weasley -'' ``###CHAR70###,'' ###CHAR68### corrected ###CHAR68### automatically. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Whatever,'' said ###CHAR50###. 
###DIALOGUE###``I've noticed ###CHAR70### sneaking around a lot lately. 
And I bet I know what ###CHAR70###'s up to. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR70### thinks ###CHAR70###'s going to catch ###CHAR45###'s heir single-handed.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### gave a short, derisive laugh. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### exchanged excited looks. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR50### paused by a stretch of bare, damp stone wall. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What's the new password again?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR50### said to ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Er -'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Oh, yeah -pure-blood!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR50###, not listening, and a stone door concealed in the wall slid open. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR50### marched through it, and ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### followed ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The Slytherin common room was a long, low underground room with rough stone walls and ceiling from which round, greenish lamps were hanging on chains. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###A fire was crackling under an elaborately carved mantelpiece ahead of them, and several Slytherins were silhouetted around it in high-backed chairs. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Wait here,'' said ###CHAR50### to ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68###, motioning them to a pair of empty chairs set back from the fire. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I'll go and get it my father's just sent it to me -'' Wondering what ###CHAR50### was going to show them, ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### sat down, doing their best to look at home. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR50### came back a minute later, holding what looked like a newspaper clipping. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR50### thrust it under ###CHAR68###'s nose. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``That'll give you a laugh,'' ###CHAR68### said. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### 's eyes widen in shock. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### read the clipping quickly, gave a very forced laugh, and handed it to ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It had been clipped out of the Daily Prophet, and it said: INQUIRY AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC ###CHAR64### , Head of the ###CHAR17### , was today fined fifty Galleons for bewitching a Muggle car. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR50### , a governor of ###CHAR26### and Wizardry, where the enchanted car crashed earlier this year, called today for ###CHAR84### 's resignation. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR55### has brought the Ministry into disrepute,'' ###CHAR50### told our reporter. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR55### is clearly unfit to draw up our laws and ###CHAR55###'s ridiculous Muggle Protection Act should be scrapped immediately.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR84### was unavailable for comment, although ###CHAR50###'s wife told reporters to clear off or she'd set the family ghoul on them. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Well?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR50### impatiently as ###CHAR68### handed the clipping back to ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Don't you think it's funny?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Ha, ha,'' said ###CHAR68### bleakly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR64### loves Muggles so much ###CHAR64### should snap ###CHAR64###'s wand in half and go and join them,'' said ###CHAR50### scornfully. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You'd never know the Weasleys were pure-bloods, the way they behave.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###'s - or rather, ###CHAR44###'s - face was contorted with fury. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What's up with you, ###CHAR44###?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###snapped ###CHAR50###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Stomachache,'' ###CHAR68### grunted. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Well, go up to the hospital wing and give all those ###CHAR14### a kick from me,'' said ###CHAR50###, snickering. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You know, I'm surprised the Daily Prophet hasn't reported all these attacks yet,'' ###CHAR50### went on thoughtfully. 
###DIALOGUE###``I suppose ###CHAR94###'s trying to hush it all up. 
###CHAR94###'ll be sacked if it doesn't stop soon. 
Father's always said old ###CHAR94###'s the worst thing that's ever happened to this place. 
He loves Muggle-borns. 
###DIALOGUE###A decent headmaster would never've let slime like that ###CHAR66### in.'' 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR50### started taking pictures with an imaginary camera and did a cruel but accurate impression of Colin: ''`###CHAR54###, can I have your picture, ###CHAR54###? 
Can I have your autograph? 
###DIALOGUE###Can I lick your shoes, please, ###CHAR54###?''' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR54### dropped ###CHAR54###'s hands and looked at ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What's the matter with you two?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Far too late, ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### forced themselves to laugh, but ###CHAR50### seemed satisfied; perhaps ###CHAR44### and Goyle were always slow on the uptake. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Saint ###CHAR54###, the Mudbloods' friend,'' said ###CHAR50### slowly. 
###DIALOGUE###``###CHAR54###'s another one with no proper wizard feeling, or ###CHAR54### wouldn't go around with that jumped up Granger Mudblood. 
###DIALOGUE###And people think he's Slytherin's heir!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### waited with bated breath: ###CHAR50### was surely seconds away from telling them it was ###CHAR50### - but then ``I wish I knew who it is,'' said ###CHAR50### petulantly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I could help them.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###'s jaw dropped so that ###CHAR44### looked even more clueless than usual. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Fortunately, ###CHAR50### didn't notice, and ###CHAR68###, thinking fast, said, ``You must have some idea who's behind it all ...'' ``You know I haven't, Goyle, how many times do I have to tell you?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###snapped ###CHAR50###. 
###DIALOGUE###``And Father won't tell me anything about the last time the Chamber was opened either. 
Of course, it was fifty years ago, so it was before his time, but he knows all about it, and he says that it was all kept quiet and it'll look suspicious if I know too much about it. 
But I know one thing - last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died. 
###DIALOGUE###So I bet it's a matter of time before one of them's killed this time ... I hope it's ###CHAR25###,'' ###CHAR50### said with relish. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### was clenching ###CHAR44###'s gigantic fists. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Feeling that it would be a bit of a giveaway if ###CHAR68### punched ###CHAR50###, ###CHAR68### shot ###CHAR68### a warning look and said, ``D'you know if the person who opened the Chamber last time was caught?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Oh, yeah ... whoever it was was expelled,'' said ###CHAR50###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``They're probably still in Azkaban.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Azkaban?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68###, puzzled. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Azkaban - the wizard prison, Goyle,'' said ###CHAR50###, looking at ###CHAR50### in disbelief ``Honestly, if you were any slower, you'd be going backward.'' 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR50### shifted restlessly in ###CHAR50###'s chair and said, ``Father says to keep my head down and let the Heir of Slytherin get on with it. 
He says the school needs ridding of all the Mudblood filth, but not to get mixed up in it. 
Of course, he's got a lot on his plate at the moment. 
###DIALOGUE###You know the ###CHAR89### raided our manor last week?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### tried to force ###CHAR6###'s dull face into a look of concern. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Yeah...'' said ###CHAR50###. 
###DIALOGUE###``Luckily, they didn't find much. 
Father's got some very valuable Dark Arts stuff. 
###DIALOGUE###But luckily, we've got our own secret chamber under the drawing-room floor -'' ``Ho!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR50### looked at ###CHAR50###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###So did ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### blushed. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Even ###CHAR68###'s hair was turning red. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###'s nose was also slowly lengthening - their hour was up, ###CHAR68### was turning back into himself, and from the look of horror ###CHAR68### was suddenly giving ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR68### must be, too. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They both jumped to their feet. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Medicine for my stomach,'' ###CHAR68### grunted, and without further ado they sprinted the length of the Slytherin common room, hurled themselves at the stone wall, and dashed up the passage, hoping against hope that ###CHAR50### hadn't noticed anything. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### could feel ###CHAR68###'s feet slipping around in Goyle's huge shoes and had to hoist up ###CHAR68###'s robes as ###CHAR68### shrank; they crashed up the steps into the dark entrance hall, which was full of a muffled pounding coming from the closet where they'd locked ###CHAR44### and Goyle. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Leaving their shoes outside the closet door, they sprinted in their socks up the marble staircase toward Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Well, it wasn't a complete waste of time,'' ###CHAR68### panted, closing the bathroom door behind them. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I know we still haven't found out who's doing the attacks, but I'm going to write to ###CHAR53### tomorrow and tell ###CHAR53### to check under the ###CHAR30###' drawing room.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### checked ###CHAR68###'s face in the cracked mirror. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### was back to normal. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### put ###CHAR68###'s glasses on as ###CHAR68### hammered on the door of ###CHAR25###'s stall. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Hermione, come out, we've got loads to tell you -'' ``Go away!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR25### squeaked. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### looked at each other. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What's the matter?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``You must be back to normal by now, we are But Moaning Myrtle glided suddenly through the stall door. 
###CHAR68### had never seen her looking so happy. 
###DIALOGUE###``Ooooooh, wait till you see,'' ###CHAR25### said. 
###DIALOGUE###``It's awful-'' They heard the lock slide back and ###CHAR25### emerged, sobbing, ###CHAR25###'s robes pulled up over ###CHAR25###'s head. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What's up?'' 
said ###CHAR68### uncertainly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Have you still got Millicent's nose or something?'' 
###CHAR25### let ###CHAR25### robes fall and ###CHAR68### backed into the sink. 
###CHAR25###'s face was covered in black fur. 
###CHAR25###'s eyes had turned yellow and there were long, pointed ears poking through ###CHAR25###'s hair. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It was a c-cat hair!'' 
###CHAR25### howled. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``M-Millicent Bulstrode m-must have a cat! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###And the p-potion isn't supposed to be used for animal transformations!'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Uh-oh,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``You'll be teased something dreadful,'' said Myrtle happily. 
###DIALOGUE###``It's okay, ###CHAR25###,'' said ###CHAR68### quickly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We'll take you up to the hospital wing. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR98### never asks too many questions ...'' It took a long time to persuade ###CHAR25### to leave the bathroom. 
Moaning Myrtle sped them on their way with a hearty guffaw. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Wait till everyone finds out you've got a tail!'' 
ermione remained in the hospital wing for several weeks. 
There was a flurry of rumor about her disappearance when the rest of the school arrived back from their Christmas holidays, because of course everyone thought that she had been attacked. 
So many students filed past the hospital wing trying to catch a glimpse of her that ###CHAR98### took out ###CHAR98###'s curtains again and placed them around ###CHAR25###'s bed, to spare ###CHAR25###'s the shame of being seen with a furry face. 
###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### went to visit ###CHAR25###'s every evening. 
When the new term started, they brought ###CHAR25###'s each day's homework. 
###DIALOGUE###``If Id sprouted whiskers, Id take a break from work,'' said ###CHAR68###, tipping a stack of books onto ###CHAR25###'s bedside table one evening. 
###DIALOGUE###``Don't be silly, ###CHAR68###, I've got to keep up,'' said ###CHAR25### briskly. 
###CHAR25###'s spirits were greatly improved by the fact that all the hair had gone from ###CHAR25###'s face and ###CHAR25###'s eyes were turning slowly back to brown. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I don't suppose you've got any new leads?'' 
###CHAR25### added in a whisper, so that ###CHAR98### couldn't hear ###CHAR98###. 
###DIALOGUE###``Nothing,'' said ###CHAR68### gloomily. 
###DIALOGUE###``I was so sure it was ###CHAR50###,'' said ###CHAR68###, for about the hundredth time. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What's that?'' 
asked ###CHAR68###, pointing to something gold sticking out from under ###CHAR25###'s pillow. 
###DIALOGUE###``Just a get well card,'' said ###CHAR25### hastily, trying to poke it out of sight, but ###CHAR68### was too quick for ###CHAR25###. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR68### pulled it out, flicked it open, and read aloud: ``To ###CHAR25### , wishing you a speedy recovery, from your concerned teacher, Professor ###CHAR73### , Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the ###CHAR57### , and five-time winner of Witch Weekly's Most- Charming-Smile Award. '' 
###CHAR68### looked up at Hermione, disgusted. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You sleep with this under your pillow?'' 
But ###CHAR25### was spared answering by ###CHAR98### sweeping over with ###CHAR25###'s evening dose of medicine. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Is ###CHAR73### the smarmiest bloke you've ever met, or what?'' 
###CHAR68### said to ###CHAR68### as they left the infirmary and started up the stairs toward Gryffindor Tower. 
###CHAR63### had given them so much homework, ###CHAR68### thought ###CHAR68### was likely to be in the sixth year before ###CHAR68### finished it. 
###CHAR68### was just saying ###CHAR68### wished ###CHAR68### had asked ###CHAR25### how many rat tails you were supposed to add to a HairRaising Potion when an angry outburst from the floor above reached their ears. 
###DIALOGUE###``That's Filch,'' ###CHAR68### muttered as they hurried up the stairs and paused, out of sight, listening hard. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You don't think someone else's been attacked?'' 
said ###CHAR68### tensely. 
They stood still, their heads inclined toward ###CHAR86###'s voice, which sounded quite hysterical. 
###DIALOGUE###`= even more work for me! 
Mopping all night, like I haven't got enough to do! 
###DIALOGUE###No, this is the final straw, I'm going to ###CHAR94### -'' ###CHAR94###'s footsteps receded along the out-of-sight corridor and they heard a distant door slam. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They poked their heads around the corner. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Filch had clearly been manning ###CHAR94###'s usual lookout post: They were once again on the spot where ###CHAR34### had been attacked. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They saw at a glance what Filch had been shouting about. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###A great flood of water stretched over half the corridor, and it looked as though it was still seeping from under the door of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Now that Filch had stopped shouting, they could hear Myrtle's wails echoing off the bathroom walls. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Now what's up with her?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Let's go and see,'' said ###CHAR68###, and holding their robes over their ankles they stepped through the great wash of water to the door bearing its OUT OF ORDER sign, ignored it as always, and entered. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Moaning ###CHAR20### was crying, if possible, louder and harder than ever before. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR20### seemed to be hiding down ###CHAR20###'s usual toilet. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It was dark in the bathroom because the candles had been extinguished in the great rush of water that had left both walls and floor soaking wet. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What's up, Myrtle?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Who's that?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###glugged Myrtle miserably. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Come to throw something else at me?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### waded across to her stall and said, ``Why would I throw something at you?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Don't ask me,'' ###CHAR20### shouted, emerging with a wave of yet more water, which splashed onto the already sopping floor. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Here I am, minding my own business, and someone thinks it's funny to throw a book at me ...'' ``But it can't hurt you if someone throws something at you,'' said ###CHAR68###, reasonably. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I mean, it'd just go right through you, wouldn't it?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### had said the wrong thing. 
###DIALOGUE###Myrtle puffed herself up and shrieked, ``Let's all throw books at Myrtle, because she can't feel it! 
Ten points if you can get it through her stomach! 
Fifty points if it goes through her head! 
Well, ha, ha, ha! 
###DIALOGUE###What a lovely game, I don't think!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Who threw it at you, anyway?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###asked ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I don't know... I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about death, and it fell right through the top of my head,'' said Myrtle, glaring at them. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It's over there, it got washed out ...'' ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### looked under the sink where ###CHAR20### was pointing. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###A small, thin book lay there. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It had a shabby black cover and was as wet as everything else in the bathroom. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### stepped forward to pick it up, but ###CHAR68### suddenly flung out an arm to hold ###CHAR68### back. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Are you crazy?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It could be dangerous.'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Dangerous?
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``said ###CHAR68###, laughing. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Come off it, how could it be dangerous?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You'd be surprised,'' said ###CHAR68###, who was looking apprehensively at the book. 
###DIALOGUE###``Some of the books the Ministry's confiscated Dad's told me - there was one that burned your eyes out. 
And everyone who read Sonnets of a Sorcerer spoke in limericks for the rest of their lives. 
And some old witch in Bath had a book that you could never stop reading! 
You just had to wander around with your nose in it, trying to do everything one-handed. 
###DIALOGUE###And -'' ``All right, I've got the point,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The little book lay on the floor, nondescript and soggy. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Well, we won't find out unless we look at it,'' ###CHAR68### said, and ###CHAR68### ducked around ###CHAR68### and picked it up off the floor. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### saw at once that it was a diary, and the faded year on the cover told ###CHAR68### it was fifty years old. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### opened it eagerly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###On the first page ###CHAR68### could just make out the name ``T ###CHAR27### '' in smudged ink. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Hang on,'' said ###CHAR68###, who had approached cautiously and was looking over ###CHAR68###'s shoulder. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I know that name ... ###CHAR27### got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``How on earth d'you know that?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68### in amazement. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Because Filch made me polish ###CHAR27###'s shield about fifty times in detention,'' said ###CHAR68### resentfully. 
###DIALOGUE###``That was the one I burped slugs all over. 
###DIALOGUE###If you'd wiped slime off a name for an hour, you'd remember it, too.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Harry peeled the wet pages apart. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They were completely blank. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There wasn't the faintest trace of writing on any of them, not even Auntie Mabel's birthday, or dentist, half-past three. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR27### never wrote in it,'' said ###CHAR68###, disappointed. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I wonder why someone wanted to flush it away?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68### curiously. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### turned to the back cover of the book and saw the printed name of a variety store on Vauxhall Road, London. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR27### must've been Muggle-born,'' said ###CHAR68### thoughtfufly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``To have bought a diary from Vauxhall Road ...'' ``Well, it's not much use to you,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### dropped ###CHAR68###'s voice. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Fifty points if you can get it through Myrtle's nose.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###, however, pocketed it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR25### left the hospital wing, de-whiskered, tail-less, and furfree, at the beginning of February. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###On ###CHAR25###'s first evening back in Gryffindor Tower, ###CHAR68### showed ###CHAR25### ###CHAR27### 's diary and told ###CHAR25###'s the story of how they had found it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Oooh, it might have hidden powers,'' said ###CHAR25### enthusiastically, taking the diary and looking at it closely. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``If it has, it's hiding them very well,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``Maybe it's shy. 
###DIALOGUE###I don't know why you don't chuck it, ###CHAR68###.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I wish I knew why someone did try to chuck it,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I wouldn't mind knowing how Riddle got an award for special services to ###CHAR26### either.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Could've been anything,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``Maybe he got thirty O.WL.s or saved a teacher from the giant squid. 
Maybe he murdered Myrtle; that would've done everyone a favor ... But ###CHAR68### could tell from the arrested look on ###CHAR25###'s face that ###CHAR25### was thinking what ###CHAR68### was thinking. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What?'' 
said ###CHAR68###, looking from one to the other. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Well, the Chamber of Secrets was opened fifty years ago, wasn't it?'' 
###CHAR68### said. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``That's what ###CHAR50### said.'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Yeah...'' said ###CHAR68### slowly. 
###DIALOGUE###``And this diary is fifty years old,'' said ###CHAR25###, tapping it excitedly. 
a so? 
. 
###DIALOGUE###``Oh, ###CHAR68###, wake up,'' snapped ###CHAR25###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We know the person who opened the Chamber last time was expelled fifty years ago. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###We know ###CHAR27### got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Well, what if ###CHAR27### got ###CHAR27###'s special award for catching the Heir of ###CHAR45###? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR27###'s diary would probably tell us everything - where the Chamber is, and how to open it, and what sort of creature lives in it - the person who's behind the attacks this time wouldn't want that lying around, would they?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``That's a brilliant theory, ###CHAR25###,'' said ###CHAR68###, ``with just one tiny little flaw. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There's nothing written in ###CHAR27###'s diary.'' 
But ###CHAR25### was pulling ###CHAR25###'s wand out of ###CHAR25###'s bag. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It might be invisible ink!'' 
###CHAR25### whispered. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR25### tapped the diary three times and said, ``Aparecium!'' 
Nothing happened. 
Undaunted, ###CHAR25### shoved ###CHAR25###'s hand back into ###CHAR25###'s bag and pulled out what appeared to be a bright red eraser. 
###DIALOGUE###``It's a Revealer, I got it in Diagon Alley,'' ###CHAR25### said. 
###CHAR25### rubbed hard on January first. 
Nothing happened. 
###DIALOGUE###``I'm telling you, there's nothing to find in there,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Riddle just got a diary for Christmas and couldn't be bothered filling it in.'' 
Harry couldn't explain, even to himself, why he didn't just throw ###CHAR27###'s diary away. 
The fact was that even though ###CHAR27### knew the diary was blank, ###CHAR27### kept absentmindedly picking it up and turning the pages, as though it were a story ###CHAR27### wanted to finish. 
And while ###CHAR68### was sure ###CHAR68### had never heard the name ###CHAR27### before, it still seemed to mean something to ###CHAR27###, almost as though ###CHAR27### was a friend ###CHAR27###'d had when ###CHAR27### was very small, and had halfforgotten. 
But this was absurd. 
###CHAR27###'d never had friends before ###CHAR26###, ###CHAR1### had made sure of that. 
Nevertheless, ###CHAR68### was determined to find out more about ###CHAR27###, so next day at break, ###CHAR27### headed for the trophy room to examine ###CHAR27###'s special award, accompanied by an interested ###CHAR25### and a thoroughly unconvinced ###CHAR68###, who told them ###CHAR68###'d seen enough of the trophy room to last ###CHAR68### a lifetime. 
###CHAR27###'s burnished gold shield was tucked away in a corner cabinet. 
It didn't carry details of why it had been given to ###CHAR27### -LRB-``Good thing, too, or it'd be even bigger and Id still be polishing it,'' said ###CHAR68###-RRB-. 
However, they did find ###CHAR27###'s name on an old Medal for Magical Merit, and on a list of old Head Boys. 
###DIALOGUE###``He sounds like ###CHAR70###,'' said ###CHAR68###, wrinkling ###CHAR68###'s nose in disgust. 
###DIALOGUE###``Prefect, Head Boy ... probably top of every class -'' ``You say that like it's a bad thing,'' said ###CHAR25### in a slightly hurt voice. 
The sun had now begun to shine weakly on ###CHAR26### again. 
Inside the castle, the mood had grown more hopeful. 
There had been no more attacks since those on ###CHAR100### and Nearly Headless ###CHAR29###, and ###CHAR98### was pleased to report that the Mandrakes were becoming moody and secretive, meaning that they were fast leaving childhood. 
###DIALOGUE###``The moment their acne clears up, they'll be ready for repotting again,'' ###CHAR68### heard ###CHAR98###'s telling Filch kindly one afternoon. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``And after that, it won't be long until we're cutting them up and stewing them. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###You'll have ###CHAR34### back in no time.'' 
Perhaps the Heir of ###CHAR45### had lost ###CHAR45###'s or ###CHAR98###'s nerve, thought ###CHAR68###. 
It must be getting riskier and riskier to open the Chamber of Secrets, with the school so alert and suspicious. 
Perhaps the monster, whatever it was, was even now settling itself down to hibernate for another fifty years ... ###CHAR40### of ###CHAR80### didn't take this cheerful view. 
###CHAR40### was still convinced that ###CHAR68### was the guilty one, that ###CHAR68### had ``given himself away'' at the Dueling Club. 
Peeves wasn't helping matters; ###CHAR68### kept popping up in the crowded corridors singing ``Oh, ###CHAR54###, you rotter ...'' now with a dance routine to match. 
###CHAR73### seemed to think ###CHAR73### himself had made the attacks stop. 
###CHAR68### overheard ###CHAR68### telling Professor ###CHAR96### so while the Gryffindors were lining up for Transfiguration. 
###DIALOGUE###``I don't think there'll be any more trouble, Minerva,'' ###CHAR68### said, tapping ###CHAR68###'s nose knowingly and winking. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I think the Chamber has been locked for good this time. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The culprit must have known it was only a matter of time before I caught him. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Rather sensible to stop now, before I came down hard on him. 
###DIALOGUE###``You know, what the school needs now is a morale-booster. 
Wash away the memories of last term! 
###DIALOGUE###I won't say any more just now, but I think I know just the thing ...'' ###CHAR68### tapped ###CHAR68###'s nose again and strode off. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR73###'s idea of a morale-booster became clear at breakfast time on February fourteenth. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### hadn't had much sleep because of a laterunning Quidditch practice the night before, and ###CHAR68### hurried down to the Great Hall, slightly late. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### thought, for a moment, that ###CHAR68###'d walked through the wrong doors. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The walls were all covered with large, lurid pink flowers. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Worse still, heart-shaped confetti was falling from the pale blue ceiling. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### went over to the Gryffindor table, where ###CHAR68### was sitting looking sickened, and ###CHAR25### seemed to have been overcome with giggles. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What's going on?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### asked them, sitting down and wiping confetti off ###CHAR68###'s bacon. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### pointed to the teachers' table, apparently too disgusted to speak. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR73###, wearing lurid pink robes to match the decorations, was waving for silence. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The teachers on either side of ###CHAR73### were looking stony-faced. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###From where ###CHAR73### sat, ###CHAR68### could see a muscle going in Professor ###CHAR96###'s cheek. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR63### looked as though someone had just fed ###CHAR68### a large beaker of Skele-Gro. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Happy Valentine's Day!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR73### shouted. 
###DIALOGUE###``And may I thank the forty-six people who have so far sent me cards! 
###DIALOGUE###Yes, I have taken the liberty of arranging this little surprise for you all - and it doesn't end here!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR73### clapped ###CHAR73###'s hands and through the doors to the entrance hall marched a dozen surly-looking dwarfs. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Not just any dwarfs, however. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR73### had them all wearing golden wings and carrying harps. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``My friendly, card-carrying cupids!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###beamed ###CHAR73###. 
###DIALOGUE###``They will be roving around the school today delivering your valentines! 
And the fun doesn't stop here! 
I'm sure my colleagues will want to enter into the spirit of the occasion! 
Why not ask Professor ###CHAR63### to show you how to whip up a Love Potion! 
###DIALOGUE###And while you're at it, Professor ###CHAR2### knows more about Entrancing Enchantments than any wizard I've ever met, the sly old dog!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Professor ###CHAR2### buried ###CHAR73###'s face in ###CHAR73###'s hands. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR63### was look ing as though the first person to ask ###CHAR63### for a Love Potion would be force-fed poison. 
###DIALOGUE###``Please, ###CHAR25###, tell me you weren't one of the forty-six, said ###CHAR68### as they left the Great Hall for their first lesson. 
###CHAR25### suddenly became very interested in searching ###CHAR25###'s bag for ###CHAR25###'s schedule and didn't answer. 
All day long, the dwarfs kept barging into their classes to deliver valentines, to the annoyance of the teachers, and late that afternoon as the Gryffindors were walking upstairs for Charms, one of the dwarfs caught up with ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Oy, you! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###`Arty Potter!'' 
shouted a particularly grim-looking dwarf, elbowing people out of the way to get to ###CHAR68###. 
Hot all over at the thought of being given a valentine in front of a line of first years, which happened to include ###CHAR76### , ###CHAR68### tried to escape. 
The dwarf, however, cut his way through the crowd by kicking people's shins, and reached him before he'd gone two paces. 
###DIALOGUE###``I've got a musical message to deliver to `Arry ###CHAR54### in person,'' he said, twanging his harp in a threatening sort of way. 
###DIALOGUE###``Not here,'' ###CHAR68### hissed, trying to escape. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Stay still!'' 
grunted the dwarf, grabbing hold of ###CHAR68###'s bag and pulling ###CHAR68### back. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Let me go!'' 
###CHAR68### snarled, tugging. 
With a loud ripping noise, ###CHAR68###'s bag split in two. 
###CHAR68###'s books, wand, parchment, and quill spilled onto the floor and ###CHAR68###'s ink bottle smashed over everything. 
###CHAR68### scrambled around, trying to pick it all up before the dwarf started singing, causing something of a holdup in the corridor. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What's going on here?'' 
came the cold, drawling voice of Draco Malfoy. 
###CHAR68### started stuffing everything feverishly into ###CHAR68###'s ripped bag, desperate to get away before ###CHAR50### could hear ###CHAR50###'s musical valentine. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What's all this commotion?'' 
said another familiar voice as ###CHAR70### arrived. 
Losing ###CHAR70###'s head, ###CHAR68### tried to make a run for it, but the dwarf seized ###CHAR68### around the knees and brought ###CHAR68### crashing to the floor. 
###DIALOGUE###``Right,'' ###CHAR68### said, sitting on ###CHAR68###'s ankles. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Here is your singing valentine: ###CHAR54###'s eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad, ###CHAR54###'s hair is as dark as a blackboard. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I wish ###CHAR54### was mine, ###CHAR54###'s really divine, The hero who conquered the Dark Lord Harry would have given all the gold in Gringotts to evaporate on the spot. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Trying valiantly to laugh along with everyone else, he got up, his feet numb from the weight of the dwarf, as ###CHAR70### did ###CHAR70###'s best to disperse the crowd, some of whom were crying with mirth. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Off you go, off you go, the bell rang five minutes ago, off to class, now,'' ###CHAR68### said, shooing some of the younger students away. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``And you, ###CHAR50###-'' ###CHAR68###, glancing over, saw ###CHAR50### stoop and snatch up something. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Leering, ###CHAR68### showed it to ###CHAR44### and ###CHAR6###, and ###CHAR68### realized that ###CHAR68###'d got ###CHAR27###'s diary. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Give that back,'' said ###CHAR68### quietly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Wonder what ###CHAR54###'s written in this?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR50###, who obvi ously hadn't noticed the year on the cover and thought ###CHAR68### had ###CHAR68###'s own diary. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###A hush fell over the onlookers. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR76### was staring from the diary to ###CHAR68###, looking terrified. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Hand it over, ###CHAR50###,'' said ###CHAR70### sternly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``When I've had a look,'' said ###CHAR50###, waving the diary tauntingly at ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR70### said, ``As a school prefect -'' but ###CHAR68### had lost ###CHAR68###'s temper. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### pulled out ###CHAR68###'s wand and shouted, ``Expelliarmus!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###and just as ###CHAR63### had disarmed ###CHAR73###, so ###CHAR50### found the diary shooting out of ###CHAR50###'s hand into the air. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###, grinning broadly, caught it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR68###!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR70### loudly. 
###DIALOGUE###``No magic in the corridors. 
###DIALOGUE###I'll have to report this, you know!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###But ###CHAR68### didn't care, ###CHAR68### was one-up on ###CHAR50###, and that was worth five points from Gryffindor any day. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR50### was looking furious, and as ###CHAR76### passed ###CHAR50### to enter ###CHAR76###'s classroom, ###CHAR50### yelled spitefully after ###CHAR76###, ``I don't think ###CHAR54### liked your valentine much!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR76### covered ###CHAR76###'s face with ###CHAR76###'s hands and ran into class. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Snarling, ###CHAR68### pulled out ###CHAR68###'s wand, too, but ###CHAR68### pulled ###CHAR68### away. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### didn't need to spend the whole of Charms belching slugs. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It wasn't until they had reached Professor ###CHAR2###'s class that ###CHAR68### noticed something rather odd about ###CHAR27###'s diary. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###All ###CHAR68###'s other books were drenched in scarlet ink. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The diary, however, was as clean as it had been before the ink bottle had smashed all over it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### tried to point this out to ###CHAR68###, but ###CHAR68### was having trouble with ###CHAR68###'s wand again; large purple bubbles were blossoming out of the end, and ###CHAR68### wasn't much interested in anything else. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### went to bed before anyone else in ###CHAR68###'s dormitory that night. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###This was partly because ###CHAR68### didn't think ###CHAR68### could stand ###CHAR55### and ###CHAR19### singing, ``###CHAR54###'s eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad'' one more time, and partly because ###CHAR68### wanted to examine ###CHAR27###'s diary again, and knew that ###CHAR68### thought ###CHAR68### was wasting ###CHAR68###'s time. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### sat on ###CHAR68###'s four-poster and flicked through the blank pages, not one of which had a trace of scarlet ink on it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Then ###CHAR68### pulled a new bottle out of ###CHAR68###'s bedside cabinet, dipped ###CHAR68###'s quill into it, and dropped a blot onto the first page of the diary. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The ink shone brightly on the paper for a second and then, as though it was being sucked into the page, vanished. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Excited, ###CHAR68### loaded up ###CHAR68###'s quill a second time and wrote, ``My name is ###CHAR54### .'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The words shone momentarily on the page and they, too, sank without trace. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Then, at last, something happened. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Oozing back out of the page, in ###CHAR68###'s very own ink, came words ###CHAR68### had never written. 
###DIALOGUE###``Hello, ###CHAR54### . 
My name is ###CHAR11### . 
###DIALOGUE###How did you come by my diary?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###These words, too, faded away, but not before ###CHAR68### had started to scribble back. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Someone tried to flush it down a toilet.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### waited eagerly for ###CHAR27###'s reply. 
###DIALOGUE###``Lucky that I recorded my memories in some more lasting way than ink. 
###DIALOGUE###But I always knew that there would be those who would not want this diary read. '' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What do you mean?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### scrawled, blotting the page in ###CHAR68###'s excitement. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###`I mean that this diary holds memories of terrible things. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Things that were covered up. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Things that happened at ###CHAR26### and Wizardry. '' 
###DIALOGUE###``That's where I am now,'' ###CHAR68### wrote quickly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I'm at Hogwarts, and horrible stuff's been happening. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets?'' 
###CHAR68###'s heart was hammering. 
###CHAR27###'s reply came quickly, ###CHAR68###'s writing becoming untidier, as though ###CHAR68### was hurrying to tell all ###CHAR68### knew. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Of course I know about the Chamber of Secrets. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###In my day, they told us it was a legend, that it did not exist. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###But this was a lie. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###In my fifth year, the Chamber was opened and the monster attacked several students, finally killing one. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I caught the person whod opened the Chamber and he was expelled. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###But the Headmaster, Professor ###CHAR5###, ashamed that such a thing had happened at ###CHAR26###, forbade me to tell the truth. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###A story was given out that thegirl had died in a freak accident. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They gave me a nice, shiny, engraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep my mouth shut. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###But I knew it could happen again. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The monster lived on, and the one who had the power to release it was not imprisoned. '' 
###CHAR68### nearly upset ###CHAR68###'s ink bottle in ###CHAR68###'s hurry to write back. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It's happening again now. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There have been three attacks and no one seems to know who's behind them. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Who was it last time?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``I can show you, if you like, ``came ###CHAR27###'s reply. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You don't have to take my word for it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I can take you inside my memory of the night when I caught ###CHAR27###. '' 
###CHAR68### hesitated, ###CHAR68###'s quill suspended over the diary. 
What did Riddle mean? 
How could he be taken inside somebody else's memory? 
He glanced nervously at the door to the dormitory, which was growing dark. 
When he looked back at the diary, he saw fresh words forming. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Let me show you. '' 
###CHAR68### paused for a fraction of a second and then wrote two letters. 
-LRB-40K The pages of the diary began to blow as though caught in a high wind, stopping halfway through the month of June. 
Mouth hanging open, ###CHAR68### saw that the little square for June thirteenth seemed to have turned into a miniscule television screen. 
###CHAR68###'s hands trembling slightly, ###CHAR68### raised the book to press ###CHAR68###'s eye against the little window, and before ###CHAR68### knew what was happening, ###CHAR68### was tilting forward; the window was widening, ###CHAR68### felt ###CHAR68###'s body leave ###CHAR68###'s bed, and ###CHAR68### was pitched headfirst through the opening in the page, into a whirl of color and shadow. 
###CHAR68### felt ###CHAR68###'s feet hit solid ground, and stood, shaking, as the blurred shapes around ###CHAR68### came suddenly into focus. 
###CHAR68### knew immediately where ###CHAR68### was. 
This circular room with the sleeping portraits was ###CHAR94###'s office - but it wasn't ###CHAR94### who was sitting behind the desk. 
A wizened, fraillooking wizard, bald except for a few wisps of white hair, was reading a letter by candlelight. 
###CHAR68### had never seen this man before. 
###DIALOGUE###``I'm sorry,'' ###CHAR68### said shakily. 
###DIALOGUE###``I didn't mean to butt in -'' But the wizard didn't look up. 
He continued to read, frowning slightly. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR68### drew nearer to ###CHAR68###'s desk and stammered, ``Er - I'll just go, shall I?'' 
Still the wizard ignored ###CHAR68###. 
###CHAR68### didn't seem even to have heard ###CHAR68###. 
Thinking that the wizard might be deaf, ###CHAR68### raised ###CHAR68###'s voice. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Sorry I disturbed you. 
###DIALOGUE###I'll go now,'' ###CHAR68### half-shouted. 
The wizard folded up the letter with a sigh, stood up, walked past ###CHAR68### without glancing at ###CHAR68###, and went to draw the curtains at ###CHAR68###'s window. 
The sky outside the window was ruby-red; it seemed to be sunset. 
The wizard went back to the desk, sat down, and twiddled his thumbs, watching the door. 
###CHAR68### looked around the office. 
No Fawkes the phoenix - no whirring silver contraptions. 
This was ###CHAR26### as ###CHAR27### had known it, meaning that this unknown wizard was Headmaster, not ###CHAR94###, and ###CHAR94###, ###CHAR68###, was little more than a phantom, completely invisible to the people of fifty years ago. 
There was a knock on the office door. 
###DIALOGUE###``Enter,'' said the old wizard in a feeble voice. 
A boy of about sixteen entered, taking off his pointed hat. 
A silver prefect's badge was glinting on his chest. 
He was much taller than ###CHAR68###, but ###CHAR68###, too, had jet-black hair. 
###DIALOGUE###``Ah, Riddle,'' said the Headmaster. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You wanted to see me, Professor ###CHAR5###?'' 
said ###CHAR27###. 
###CHAR27### looked nervous. 
###DIALOGUE###``Sit down,'' said ###CHAR5###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I've just been reading the letter you sent me. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Oh,'' said ###CHAR27###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR27### sat down, gripping ###CHAR27###'s hands together very tightly. 
###DIALOGUE###``My dear boy,'' said Dipper kindly, ``I cannot possibly let you stay at school over the summer. 
###DIALOGUE###Surely you want to go home for the holidays?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``No,'' said ###CHAR27### at once. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Id much rather stay at Hogwarts than go back to that - to that -'' ``You live in a Muggle orphanage during the holidays, I believe?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR5### curiously. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Yes, sir,'' said ###CHAR27###, reddening slightly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You are Muggle-born?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Half-blood, sir,'' said ###CHAR27###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Muggle father, witch mother.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``And are both your parents -?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``My mother died just after I was born, sir. 
###DIALOGUE###They told me at the orphanage she lived just long enough to name me - ###CHAR11### after my father, Marvolo after my grandfather.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Dipper clucked ###CHAR27###'s tongue sympathetically. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``The thing is, ###CHAR11###,'' ###CHAR27### sighed, ``Special arrangements might have been made for you, but in the current circumstances ...'' ``You mean all these attacks, sir?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR27###, and ###CHAR68###'s heart leapt, and ###CHAR68### moved closer, scared of missing anything. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Precisely,'' said the headmaster. 
###DIALOGUE###``My dear boy, you must see how foolish it would be of me to allow you to remain at the castle when term ends. 
Particularly in light of the recent tragedy ... the death of that poor little girl ... You will be safer by far at your orphanage. 
As a matter of fact, the ###CHAR89### is even now talking about closing the school. 
###DIALOGUE###We are no nearer locating the er - source of all this unpleasantness ...'' ###CHAR27###'s eyes had widened. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Sir - if the person was caught - if it all stopped -'' ``What do you mean?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR5### with a squeak in ###CHAR27###'s voice, sitting up in ###CHAR27###'s chair. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Riddle, do you mean you know something about these attacks?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``No, sir,'' said ###CHAR27### quickly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###But ###CHAR68### was sure it was the same sort of ``no'' that ###CHAR27### himself had given ###CHAR94###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Dippet sank back, looking faintly disappointed. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You may go, ###CHAR11### ...'' Riddle slid off his chair and slouched out of the room. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### followed ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Down the moving spiral staircase they went, emerging next to the gargoyle in the darkening corridor. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR27### stopped, and so did ###CHAR68###, watching ###CHAR27###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### could tell that ###CHAR27### was doing some serious thinking. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR27### was biting ###CHAR27###'s lip, ###CHAR27###'s forehead furrowed. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Then, as though ###CHAR27### had suddenly reached a decision, ###CHAR27### hurried off, ###CHAR68### gliding noiselessly behind ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They didn't see another person until they reached the entrance hall, when a tall wizard with long, sweeping auburn hair and a beard called to Riddle from the marble staircase. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What are you doing, wandering around this late, ###CHAR11###?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### gaped at the wizard. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### was none other than a fifty-yearyounger ###CHAR94###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I had to see the headmaster, sir,'' said ###CHAR27###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Well, hurry off to bed,'' said ###CHAR94###, giving ###CHAR27### exactly the kind of penetrating stare ###CHAR68### knew so well. 
###DIALOGUE###``Best not to roam the corridors these days. 
###DIALOGUE###Not since ...'' ###CHAR27### sighed heavily, bade ###CHAR27### good night, and strode off. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR27### watched ###CHAR27### walk out of sight and then, moving quickly, headed straight down the stone steps to the dungeons, with ###CHAR68### in hot pursuit. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###But to ###CHAR68###'s disappointment, ###CHAR27### led ###CHAR27### not into a hidden passageway or a secret tunnel but to the very dungeon in which ###CHAR68### had Potions with ###CHAR63###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The torches hadn't been lit, and when ###CHAR27### pushed the door almost closed, ###CHAR68### could only just see ###CHAR68###, standing stock-still by the door, watching the passage outside. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It felt to ###CHAR68### that they were there for at least an hour. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###All ###CHAR68### could see was the figure of Riddle at the door, staring through the crack, waiting like a statue. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###And just when ###CHAR68### had stopped feeling expectant and tense and started wishing ###CHAR68### could return to the present, ###CHAR68### heard something move beyond the door. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Someone was creeping along the passage. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### heard whoever it was pass the dungeon where ###CHAR68### and Riddle were hidden. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR27###, quiet as a shadow, edged through the door and followed, ###CHAR68### tiptoeing behind ###CHAR68###, forgetting that ###CHAR68### couldn't be heard. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###For perhaps five minutes they followed the footsteps, until ###CHAR27### stopped suddenly, ###CHAR27###'s head inclined in the direction of new noises. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### heard a door creak open, and then someone speaking in a hoarse whisper. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``C'mon ... gotta get yeh outta here ... C'mon now ... in the box...'' There was something familiar about that voice ... Riddle suddenly jumped around the corner. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### stepped out behind ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### could see the dark outline of a huge boy who was crouching in front of an open door, a very large box next to it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Evening, ###CHAR72###,'' said ###CHAR27### sharply. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The boy slammed the door shut and stood up. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What yer doin' down here, ###CHAR11###?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR27### stepped closer. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It's all over,'' ###CHAR27### said. 
###DIALOGUE###``I'm going to have to turn you in, ###CHAR72###. 
###DIALOGUE###They're talking about closing ###CHAR26### if the attacks don't stop.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``N'' at d'yeh -'' ``I don't think you meant to kill anyone. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###But monsters don't make good pets. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I suppose you just let it out for exercise and -'' ``It never killed no one!'' 
said the large boy, backing against the closed door. 
From behind ###CHAR27###, ###CHAR68### could hear a funny rustling and clicking. 
###DIALOGUE###``Come on, ###CHAR72###,'' said ###CHAR27###, moving yet closer. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The least ###CHAR26### can do is make sure that the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered ...'' ``It wasn't ###CHAR26###!'' 
roared the boy, ###CHAR27###'s voice echoing in the dark passage. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR26### wouldn'! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR26### never!'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Stand aside,'' said ###CHAR27###, drawing out ###CHAR27###'s wand. 
###CHAR27###'s spell lit the corridor with a sudden flaming light. 
The door behind the large boy flew open with such force it knocked him into the wall opposite. 
And out of it came something that made ###CHAR68### let out a long, piercing scream unheard by anyone A vast, low-slung, hairy body and a tangle of black legs; a gleam of many eyes and a pair of razor-sharp pincers - ###CHAR27### raised ###CHAR27###'s wand again, but ###CHAR27### was too late. 
The thing bowled ###CHAR27### over as it scuttled away, tearing up the corridor and out of sight. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR27### scrambled to ###CHAR27###'s feet, looking after it; ###CHAR27### raised ###CHAR27###'s wand, but the huge boy leapt on him, seized his wand, and threw him back down, yelling, ``NOOOOOOO!'' 
The scene whirled, the darkness became complete; ###CHAR68### felt himself falling and, with a crash, ###CHAR68### landed spread-eagled on ###CHAR68###'s four-poster in the Gryffindor dormitory, ###CHAR27###'s diary lying open on ###CHAR27###'s stomach. 
Before ###CHAR27### had had time to regain ###CHAR27###'s breath, the dormitory door opened and ###CHAR68### came in. 
###DIALOGUE###``There you are,'' ###CHAR68### said. 
###CHAR68### sat up. 
###CHAR68### was sweating and shaking. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What's up?'' 
said ###CHAR68###, looking at ###CHAR68### with concern. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It was ###CHAR22###, ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR22### opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago.'' 
###CHAR68###, ###CHAR68###, and ###CHAR25### had always known that ###CHAR22### had an unfortunate liking for large and monstrous creatures. 
###DIALOGUE###During their first year at ###CHAR26### had tried to raise a dragon in ###CHAR26###'s little wooden house, and it would be a long time before they forgot the giant, threeheaded dog ###CHAR26###'d christened ``Fluffy.'' 
And if, as a boy, ###CHAR22### had heard that a monster was hidden somewhere in the castle, ###CHAR68### was sure ###CHAR68###'d have gone to any lengths for a glimpse of it. 
###CHAR68###'d probably thought it was a shame that the monster had been cooped up so long, and thought it deserved the chance to stretch its many legs; ###CHAR68### could just imagine the thirteen-year-old ###CHAR22### trying to fit a leash and collar on it. 
But ###CHAR68### was equally certain that ###CHAR22### would never have meant to kill anybody. 
###CHAR68### half wished ###CHAR68### hadn't found out how to work ###CHAR27###'s diary. 
Again and again ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### made ###CHAR68### recount what ###CHAR68###'d seen, until ###CHAR68### was heartily sick of telling them and sick of the long, circular conversations that followed. 
###DIALOGUE###``Riddle might have got the wrong person,'' said ###CHAR25###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Maybe it was some other monster that was attacking people ...'' ``How many monsters d'you think this place can hold?'' 
###CHAR68### asked dully. 
###DIALOGUE###``We always knew ###CHAR22### had been expelled,'' said ###CHAR68### miserably. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``And the attacks must've stopped after ###CHAR22### was kicked out. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Otherwise, ###CHAR27### wouldn't have got ###CHAR27###'s award.'' 
###CHAR68### tried a different tack. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Riddle does sound like ###CHAR70### - who asked ###CHAR70### to squeal on ###CHAR22###, anyway?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``But the monster had killed someone, ###CHAR68###,'' said ###CHAR25###. 
###DIALOGUE###``And ###CHAR27### was going to go back to some Muggle orphanage if they closed ###CHAR26###,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I don't blame ###CHAR27### for wanting to stay here ...'' ``You met ###CHAR22### down Knockturn Alley, didn't you, ###CHAR68###?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``###CHAR68### was buying a Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent,'' said ###CHAR68### quickly. 
The three of them fell silent. 
After a long pause, ###CHAR25### voiced the knottiest question of all in a hesitant voice. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Do you think we should go and ask ###CHAR22### about it all?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``That'd be a cheerful visit,'' said ###CHAR68###. ''
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###`Hello, ###CHAR22###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?''' 
In the end, they decided that they would not say anything to ###CHAR22### unless there was another attack, and as more and more days went by with no whisper from the disembodied voice, they became hopeful that they would never need to talk to ###CHAR68### about why ###CHAR68### had been expelled. 
It was now nearly four months since ###CHAR100### and Nearly Headless ###CHAR29### had been Petrified, and nearly everybody seemed to think that the attacker, whoever it was, had retired for good. 
Peeves had finally got bored of his ``Oh, ###CHAR54###, you rotter'' song, ###CHAR40### asked ###CHAR68### quite politely to pass a bucket of leaping toadstools in Herbology one day, and in March several of the Mandrakes threw a loud and raucous party in greenhouse three. 
This made Professor Sprout very happy. 
###DIALOGUE###``The moment they start trying to move into each other's pots, we'll know they're fully mature,'' she told ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Then we'll be able to revive those poor people in the hospital wing.'' 
The second years were given something new to think about during their Easter holidays. 
The time had come to choose their subjects for the third year, a matter that ###CHAR25###, at least, took very seriously. 
###DIALOGUE###``it could affect our whole future,'' ###CHAR25### told ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### as they pored over lists of new subjects, marking them with checks. 
###DIALOGUE###``I just want to give up Potions,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``We can't,'' said ###CHAR68### gloomily. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We keep all our old subjects, or I'd've ditched Defense Against the Dark Arts.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But that's very important!'' 
said ###CHAR25###, shocked. 
###DIALOGUE###``Not the way ###CHAR73### teaches it,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I haven't learned anything from ###CHAR73### except not to set pixies loose.'' 
###CHAR92### had been sent letters from all the witches and wizards in ###CHAR68###'s family, all giving ###CHAR68### different advice on what to choose. 
Confused and worried, ###CHAR68### sat reading the subject lists with ###CHAR68###'s tongue poking out, asking people whether they thought Arithmancy sounded more difficult than the study of Ancient Runes. 
###CHAR28### , who, like ###CHAR68###, had grown up with ###CHAR7###, ended up closing ###CHAR68###'s eyes and jabbing ###CHAR68###'s wand at the list, then picking the subjects it landed on. 
###CHAR25### took nobody's advice but signed up for everything. 
###CHAR68### smiled grimly to himself at the thought of what Uncle ###CHAR35### and ###CHAR78### would say if ###CHAR35### tried to discuss ###CHAR35###'s career in wizardry with them. 
Not that ###CHAR35### didn't get any guidance: ###CHAR70### was eager to share ###CHAR70###'s experience. 
###DIALOGUE###``Depends where you want to go, ###CHAR68###,'' ###CHAR70### said. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It's never too early to think about the future, so Id recommend Divination. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###People say Muggle Studies is a soft option, but I personally think wizards should have a thorough understanding of the non-magical community, particularly if they're thinking of working in close contact with them - look at my father, he has to deal with ###CHAR17### business all the time. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###My brother ###CHAR49### was always more of an outdoor type, so ###CHAR49### went for Care of Magical Creatures. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Play to your strengths, ###CHAR68###.'' 
But the only thing ###CHAR68### felt ###CHAR68### was really good at was Quidditch. 
In the end, ###CHAR68### chose the same new subjects as ###CHAR68###, feeling that if ###CHAR68### was lousy at them, at least ###CHAR68###'d have someone friendly to help ###CHAR68###. 
Gryffindor's next Quidditch match would be against ###CHAR80###. 
###CHAR43### was insisting on team practices every night after dinner, so that ###CHAR68### barely had time for anything but Quidditch and homework. 
However, the training sessions were getting better, or at least drier, and the evening before Saturday's match ###CHAR68### went up to ###CHAR68###'s dormitory to drop off ###CHAR68###'s broomstick feeling Gryffindor's chances for the Quidditch cup had never been better. 
But ###CHAR68###'s cheerful mood didn't last long. 
At the top of the stairs to the dormitory, ###CHAR68### met ###CHAR92### , who was looking frantic. 
###DIALOGUE###``Harry - I don't know who did it - I just found -'' Watching ###CHAR68### fearfully, ###CHAR92### pushed open the door. 
The contents of ###CHAR68###'s trunk had been thrown everywhere. 
###CHAR68###'s cloak lay ripped on the floor. 
The bedclothes had been pulled off ###CHAR68###'s four-poster and the drawer had been pulled out of ###CHAR68###'s bedside cabinet, the contents strewn over the mattress. 
###CHAR68### walked over to the bed, open-mouthed, treading on a few loose pages of Travels with Trolls. 
As ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR92### pulled the blankets back onto ###CHAR68###'s bed, ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR28###, and ###CHAR4### came in. 
Dean swore loudly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What happened, ###CHAR68###?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``No idea,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
But ###CHAR68### was examining ###CHAR68###'s robes. 
All the pockets were hanging out. 
###DIALOGUE###``Someone's been looking for something,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Is there anything missing?'' 
###CHAR68### started to pick up all ###CHAR68###'s things and throw them into ###CHAR68###'s trunk. 
It was only as ###CHAR68### threw the last of the ###CHAR73### books back into it that ###CHAR68### realized what wasn't there. 
###DIALOGUE###``Riddle's diary's gone,'' ###CHAR68### said in an undertone to ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What?'' 
###CHAR68### jerked ###CHAR68###'s head toward the dormitory door and ###CHAR68### followed ###CHAR68### out. 
They hurried down to the Gryffindor common room, which was half-empty, and joined ###CHAR25###, who was sitting alone, reading a book called Ancient Runes Made Easy. 
###CHAR25### looked aghast at the news. 
###DIALOGUE###``But - only a Gryffindor could have stolen - nobody else knows our password -'' ``Exactly,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
They woke the next day to brilliant sunshine and a light, refreshing breeze. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Perfect Quidditch conditions!'' 
said ###CHAR43### enthusiastically at the Gryffindor table, loading the team's plates with scrambled eggs. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Harry, buck up there, you need a decent breakfast.'' 
###CHAR68### had been staring down the packed Gryffindor table, wondering if the new owner of ###CHAR27###'s diary was right in front of ###CHAR68###'s eyes. 
###CHAR25### had been urging ###CHAR68### to report the robbery, but ###CHAR68### didn't like the idea. 
###CHAR68###'d have to tell a teacher all about the diary, and how many people knew why ###CHAR22### had been expelled fifty years ago? 
###CHAR68### didn't want to be the one who brought it all up again. 
As ###CHAR68### left the Great Hall with ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### to go and collect ###CHAR68###'s Quidditch things, another very serious worry was added to ###CHAR68###'s growing list. 
###CHAR68### had just set foot on the marble staircase when ###CHAR68### heard it yet again ``Kill this time ... let me rip ... tear...'' ###CHAR68### shouted aloud and ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25### both jumped away from ###CHAR68### in alarm. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``The voice!'' 
said ###CHAR68###, -looking over ###CHAR68###'s shoulder. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I just heard it again - didn't you?'' 
###CHAR68### shook ###CHAR68###'s head, wide-eyed. 
###CHAR25###, however, clapped a hand to ###CHAR25###'s forehead. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Harry - I think I've just understood something! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I've got to go to the library!'' 
And ###CHAR25### sprinted away, up the stairs. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What does she understand?'' 
said ###CHAR68### distractedly, still looking around, trying to tell where the voice had come from. 
###DIALOGUE###``Loads more than I do,'' said ###CHAR68###, shaking ###CHAR68###'s head. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But why's she got to go to the library?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Because that's what ###CHAR25### does,'' said ###CHAR68###, shrugging. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``When in doubt, go to the library.'' 
###CHAR68### stood, irresolute, trying to catch the voice again, but people were now emerging from the Great Hall behind ###CHAR68###, talking loudly, exiting through the front doors on their way to the Quidditch pitch. 
###DIALOGUE###``You'd better get moving,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``It's nearly eleven - the match - '' ###CHAR68### raced up to Gryffindor Tower, collected ###CHAR68###'s Nimbus Two Thousand, and joined the large crowd swarming across the grounds, but ###CHAR68###'s mind was still in the castle along with the bodiless voice, and as ###CHAR68### pulled on ###CHAR68###'s scarlet robes in the locker. 
room, ###CHAR68###'s only comfort was that everyone was now outside to watch the game. 
The teams walked onto the field to tumultuous applause. 
###CHAR43### took off for a warm-up flight around the goal posts; Madam Hooch released the balls. 
The Hufflepuffs, who played in canary yellow, were standing in a huddle, having a last-minute discussion of tactics. 
###CHAR68### was just mounting ###CHAR68###'s broom when Professor ###CHAR96### came half marching, half running across the pitch, carrying an enormous purple megaphone. 
###CHAR68###'s heart dropped like a stone. 
###DIALOGUE###``This match has been cancelled,'' Professor ###CHAR96### called through the megaphone, addressing the packed stadium. 
There were boos and shouts. 
###CHAR43### , looking devastated, landed and ran toward Professor ###CHAR96### without getting off his broomstick. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But, Professor!'' 
he shouted. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We've got to play - the cup Gryffindor -'' Professor ###CHAR96### ignored him and continued to shout through ###CHAR43###'s megaphone: ``All students are to make their way back to the ###CHAR42### common rooms, where their Heads of Houses will give them further information. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###As quickly as you can, please!'' 
Then ###CHAR43### lowered the megaphone and beckoned ###CHAR68### over to ###CHAR43###. 
###DIALOGUE###``###CHAR54###, I think you'd better come with me ...'' Wondering how ###CHAR43### could possibly suspect ###CHAR68### this time, ###CHAR68### detach himself from the complaining crowd; ###CHAR68### came running up to them as they set off toward the castle. 
To ###CHAR68###'s surprise, Professor ###CHAR96### didn't object. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Yes, perhaps you'd better come, too, ###CHAR55### ... Some of the students swarming around them were grumbling about the match being canceled; others looked worried. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### followed Professor ###CHAR96### back into the school and up the marble staircase. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###But they weren't taken to anybody's office this time. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``This will be a bit of a shock,'' said Professor ###CHAR96### in a surprisingly gentle voice as they approached the infirmary. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``There has been another attack ... another double attack.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###'s insides did a horrible somersault. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Professor ###CHAR96### pushed the door open and he and ###CHAR68### entered. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR98### was bending over a fifth-year girl with long, curly hair. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### recognized ###CHAR98### as the Ravenclaw they'd accidentally asked for directions to the Slytherin common room. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###And on the bed next to ###CHAR98### was ``Hermione!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### groaned. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR25### lay utterly still, ###CHAR25###'s eyes open and glassy. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``They were found near the library,'' said Professor ###CHAR96###. 
###DIALOGUE###``I don't suppose either of you can explain this? 
###DIALOGUE###It was on the floor next to them ...'' ###CHAR25### was holding up a small, circular mirror. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### shook their heads, both staring at Hermione. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I will escort you back to Gryffindor Tower,'' said Professor ###CHAR96### heavily. 
###DIALOGUE###``I need to address the students in any case. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``All students will return to their ###CHAR42### common rooms by six o'clock in the evening. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###No student is to leave the dormitories after that time. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###You will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###No student is to use the bathroom unaccompanied by a teacher. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###All further Quidditch training and matches are to be postponed. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There will be no more evening activities.'' 
The Gryffindors packed inside the common room listened to Professor ###CHAR96### in silence. 
###DIALOGUE###She rolled up the parchment from which she had been reading and said in a somewhat choked voice, ``I need hardly add that I have rarely been so distressed. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It is likely that the school will be closed unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I would urge anyone who thinks they might know anything about them to come forward.'' 
She climbed somewhat awkwardly out of the portrait hole, and the Gryffindors began talking immediately. 
###DIALOGUE###``That's two Gryffindors down, not counting a Gryffindor ghost, one Ravenclaw, and one ###CHAR80###, '' said the ###CHAR55### twins' friend ###CHAR97### , counting on ###CHAR97###'s fingers. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Haven't any of the teachers noticed that the Slytherins are all safe? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Isn't it obvious all this stuff's coming from Slytherin? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The Heir of Slytherin, the monster of Slytherin - why don't they just chuck all the Slytherins out?'' 
###CHAR97### roared, to nods and scattered applause. 
###CHAR70### was sitting in a chair behind ###CHAR97###, but for once ###CHAR97### didn't seem keen to make ###CHAR97###'s views heard. 
###CHAR97### was looking pale and stunned. 
###DIALOGUE###``Percy's in shock,'' ###CHAR19### told ###CHAR68### quietly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``That Ravenclaw girl - ###CHAR61### - ###CHAR61###'s a prefect. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I don't think he thought the monster would dare attack a prefect.'' 
But ###CHAR68### was only half-listening. 
###CHAR68### didn't seem to be able to get rid of the picture of ###CHAR25###, lying on the hospital bed as though carved out of stone. 
And if the culprit wasn't caught soon, he was looking at a lifetime back with the ###CHAR88###. 
###CHAR11### had turned ###CHAR22### in because ###CHAR11### was faced with the prospect of a Muggle orphanage if the school closed. 
###CHAR68### now knew exactly how ###CHAR68### had felt. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What're we going to do?'' 
said ###CHAR68### quietly in ###CHAR68###'s ear. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``D'you think they suspect ###CHAR22###?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``We've got to go and talk to him,'' said ###CHAR68###, making up ###CHAR68###'s mind. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I can't believe it's him this time, but if he set the monster loose last time he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets, and that's a start.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But ###CHAR96### said we've got to stay in our tower unless we're in class -'' ``I think,'' said ###CHAR68###, more quietly still, ``it's time to get my dad's old cloak out again.'' 
###CHAR68### had inherited-RRB- ust one thing from ###CHAR68###'s father: a long and sil very Invisibility Cloak. 
It was their only chance of sneaking out of the school to visit ###CHAR22### without anyone knowing about it. 
They went to bed at the usual time, waited until ###CHAR92###, ###CHAR28###, and Sea mus had stopped discussing the Chamber of Secrets and finally fallen asleep, then got up, dressed again, and threw the cloak over themselves. 
The journey through the dark and deserted castle corridors wasn't enjoyable. 
###CHAR68###, who had wandered the castle at night sev eral times before, had never seen it so crowded after sunset. 
Teach ers, prefects, and ghosts were marching the corridors in pairs, staring around for any unusual activity. 
Their Invisibility Cloak didn't stop them making any noise, and there was a particularly tense moment when ###CHAR68### stubbed ###CHAR68###'s toe only yards from the spot where ###CHAR63### stood standing guard. 
Thankfully, ###CHAR63### sneezed at almost exactly the moment ###CHAR68### swore. 
It was with relief that they reached the oak front doors and eased them open. 
It was a clear, starry night. 
They hurried toward the lit windows of ###CHAR22###'s house and pulled off the cloak only when they were right outside ###CHAR68###'s front door. 
Seconds after they had knocked, ###CHAR22### flung it open. 
They found themselves face-to-face with ###CHAR68### aiming a crossbow at them. 
###CHAR58### the boarhound barked loudly behind ###CHAR58###. 
###DIALOGUE###``Oh,'' ###CHAR58### said, lowering the weapon and staring at them. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What're you two doin' here?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What's that for?'' 
said ###CHAR68###, pointing at the crossbow as they stepped inside. 
###DIALOGUE###``Nothin' - nothin' - '' ###CHAR22### muttered. 
###DIALOGUE###``I've bin expectin' doesn' matter - Sit down - I'll make tea -'' ###CHAR68### hardly seemed to know what ###CHAR68### was doing. 
###CHAR68### nearly extinguished the fire, spilling water from the kettle on it, and then smashed the teapot with a nervous jerk of his massive hand. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Are you okay, ###CHAR22###?'' 
said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Did you hear about ###CHAR25###?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Oh, I heard, all righ','' said ###CHAR22###, a slight break in ###CHAR68###'s voice. 
###CHAR68### kept glancing nervously at the windows. 
###CHAR68### poured them both large mugs of boiling water -LRB-###CHAR68### had forgotten to add tea bags-RRB- and was just putting a slab of fruitcake on a plate when there was a loud knock on the door. 
###CHAR22### dropped the fruitcake. 
###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### exchanged panicstricken looks, then threw the Invisibility Cloak back over themselves and retreated into a corner. 
###CHAR22### checked that they were hidden, seized ###CHAR68###'s crossbow, and flung open ###CHAR68###'s door once more. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Good evening, ###CHAR22###.'' 
It was ###CHAR94###. 
###CHAR94### entered, looking deadly serious, and was followed by a second, very odd-looking man. 
The stranger had rumpled gray hair and an anxious expression, and was wearing a strange mixture of clothes: a pinstriped suit, a scarlet tie, a long black cloak, and pointed purple boots. 
Under his arm he carried a lime-green bowler. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``That's Dad's boss!'' 
###CHAR68### breathed. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR67### , the Minister of Magic!'' 
###CHAR68### elbowed ###CHAR68### hard to make ###CHAR68### shut up. 
###CHAR22### had gone pale and sweaty. 
###CHAR68### dropped into one of ###CHAR68###'s chairs and looked from ###CHAR94### to ###CHAR67### . 
###DIALOGUE###``Bad business, ###CHAR22###,'' said Fudge in rather clipped tones. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Very bad business. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Had to come. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Four attacks on Muggle-borns. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Things've gone far enough. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Ministry's got to act.'' 
###DIALOGUE###``I never,'' said ###CHAR22###, looking imploringly at ###CHAR94###. 
###DIALOGUE###``You know I never, Professor ###CHAR94###, sir -'' ``I want it understood, ###CHAR67###, that ###CHAR22### has my full confidence,'' said ###CHAR94###, frowning at Fudge. 
###DIALOGUE###``Look, ###CHAR94###,'' said Fudge, uncomfortably. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Hagrid's record's against ###CHAR94###. 
###DIALOGUE###Ministry's got to do something - the school governors have been in touch -'' ``Yet again, ###CHAR67###, I tell you that taking ###CHAR22### away will not help in the slightest,'' said ###CHAR94###. 
###CHAR94###'s blue eyes were full of a fire ###CHAR68### had never seen before. 
###DIALOGUE###``Look at it from my point of view,'' said Fudge, fidgeting with ###CHAR68###'s bowler. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I'm under a lot of pressure. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Got to be seen to be doing something. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###If it turns out it wasn't ###CHAR22###, ###CHAR67###'ll be back and no more said. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###But I've got to take ###CHAR67###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Got to. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Wouldn't be doing my duty -'' ``Take me?'' 
said ###CHAR22###, who was trembling. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Take me where?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``For a short stretch only,'' said Fudge, not meeting ###CHAR22###'s eyes. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Not a punishment, ###CHAR22###, more a precaution. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###If someone else is caught, you'll be let out with a full apology -'' ``Not Azkaban?'' 
croaked ###CHAR22###. 
Before Fudge could answer, there was another loud rap on the door. 
###CHAR94### answered it. 
It was ###CHAR68###'s turn for an elbow in the ribs; ###CHAR68###'d let out an audible gasp. 
###CHAR50### strode into ###CHAR22###'s hut, swathed in a long black traveling cloak, smiling a cold and satisfied smile. 
###CHAR58### started to growl. 
###DIALOGUE###``Already here, Fudge,'' ###CHAR58### said approvingly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Good, good...'' ``What're you doin' here?'' 
said ###CHAR22### furiously. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Get outta my house!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``My dear man, please believe me, I have no pleasure at all in being inside your - er - d'you call this a house?'' 
said ###CHAR50### , sneering as ###CHAR50### looked around the small cabin. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I simply called at the school and was told that the headmaster was here.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``And what exactly did you want with me, ###CHAR50###?'' 
said ###CHAR94###. 
###CHAR94### spoke politely, but the fire was still blazing in ###CHAR94###'s blue eyes. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Dreadful thing, ###CHAR94###,'' said ###CHAR50### lazily, taking out a long roll of parchment, ``but the governors feel it's time for you to step aside. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###This is an Order of Suspension - you'll find all twelve signatures on it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I'm afraid we feel you're losing your touch. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###How many attacks have there been now? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Two more this afternoon, wasn't it? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###At this rate, there'll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts, and we all know what an awful loss that would be to the school.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Oh, now, see here, ###CHAR50###,'' said Fudge, looking alarmed, ``###CHAR94### suspended - no, no - last thing we want just now ``The appointment - or suspension - of the headmaster is a matter for the governors, Fudge,'' said ###CHAR50### smoothly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``And as ###CHAR94### has failed to stop these attacks -'' ``See here, ###CHAR50###, if ###CHAR94### can't stop them,'' said Fudge, whose upper lip was sweating now, ``I mean to say, who can?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``That remains to be seen,'' said ###CHAR50### with a nasty smile. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But as all twelve of us have voted -'' ###CHAR22### leapt to ###CHAR50###'s feet, ###CHAR50###'s shaggy black head grazing the ceiling. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###`An' how many did yeh have ter threaten an' blackmail before they agreed, ###CHAR50###, eh?'' 
###CHAR50### roared. 
###DIALOGUE###``Dear, dear, you know, that temper of yours will lead you into trouble one of these days, ###CHAR22###,'' said ###CHAR50### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I would advise you not to shout at the Azkaban guards like that. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They won't like it at all.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Yeh can' take ###CHAR94###!'' 
yelled ###CHAR22###, making ###CHAR58### the boarhound cower and whimper in ###CHAR50###'s basket. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Take ###CHAR94### away, an' the Muggle-borns won' stand a chance! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There'll be killin' next!'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Calm yourself, ###CHAR22###,'' said ###CHAR94### sharply. 
###CHAR94### looked at ###CHAR50### . 
###DIALOGUE###``If the governors want my removal, ###CHAR50###, I shall of course step aside -'' ``But -'' stuttered Fudge. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``No!
###DIALOGUE###``growled ###CHAR22###. 
###CHAR94### had not taken ###CHAR94###'s bright blue eyes off ###CHAR50### 's cold gray ones. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``However,'' said ###CHAR94###, speaking very slowly and clearly so that none of them could miss a word, ``you will find that I will ummer was creeping over the grounds around the castle; sky and lake alike turned periwinkle blue and flowers large as cabbages burst into bloom in the greenhouses. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###But with no Hagrid visible from the castle windows, striding the grounds with ###CHAR58### at ###CHAR58###'s heels, the scene didn't look right to ###CHAR68###; no better, in fact, than the inside of the castle, where things were so horribly wrong. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### had tried to visit ###CHAR25###, but visitors were now barred from the hospital wing. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We're taking no more chances,'' ###CHAR98### told them severely through a crack in the infirmary door. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``No, I'm sorry, there's every chance the attacker might come back to finish these people off ...'' With ###CHAR94### gone, fear had spread as never before, so that the sun warming the castle walls outside seemed to stop at the mullioned windows. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There was barely a face to be seen in the school that didn't look worried and tense, and any laughter that rang through the corridors sounded shrill and unnatural and was quickly stifled. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### constantly repeated ###CHAR94###'s final words to himself ``I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me... Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###But what good were these words? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Who exactly were they supposed to ask for help, when everyone was just as confused and scared as they were? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR22###'s hint about the spiders was far easier to understand the trouble was, there didn't seem to be a single spider left in the castle to follow. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### looked everywhere ###CHAR68### went, helped -LRB-rather reluctantly-RRB- by ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They were hampered, of course, by the fact that they weren't allowed to wander off on their own but had to move around the castle in a pack with the other Gryffindors. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Most of their fellow students seemed glad that they were being shepherded from class to class by teachers, but ###CHAR68### found it very irksome. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###One person, however, seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the atmosphere of terror and suspicion. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR0### was strutting around the school as though ###CHAR0### had just been appointed Head Boy. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### didn't realize what ###CHAR68### was so pleased about until the Potions lesson about two weeks after ###CHAR94### and ###CHAR22### had left, when, sitting right behind ###CHAR50###, ###CHAR68### overheard ###CHAR68### gloating to Crabbe and Goyle. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I always thought Father might be the one who got rid of ###CHAR94###,'' ###CHAR68### said, not troubling to keep ###CHAR68###'s voice down. 
###DIALOGUE###``I told you ###CHAR94### thinks ###CHAR94###'s the worst headmaster the school's ever had. 
Maybe we'll get a decent headmaster now. 
Someone who won't want the Chamber of Secrets closed. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR96### won't last long, she's only filling in ...'' ###CHAR63### swept past ###CHAR68###, making no comment about ###CHAR25###'s empty seat and cauldron. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Sir,'' said ###CHAR50### loudly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Sir, why don't you apply for the headmaster's job?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Now, now, ###CHAR50###,'' said ###CHAR63###, though ###CHAR63### couldn't suppress a thinlipped smile. 
###DIALOGUE###``Professor ###CHAR94### has only been suspended by the governors. 
###DIALOGUE###I daresay ###CHAR94###'ll be back with us soon enough.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Yeah, right,'' said ###CHAR50###, smirking. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I expect you'd have Father's vote, sir, if you wanted to apply for the job - I'll tell Father you're the best teacher here, sir -'' ###CHAR63### smirked as ###CHAR63### swept off around the dungeon, fortunately not spotting ###CHAR4### , who was pretending to vomit into ###CHAR4###'s cauldron. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I'm quite surprised the Mudbloods haven't all packed their bags by now,'' ###CHAR50### went on. 
###DIALOGUE###``Bet you five Galleons the next one dies. 
###DIALOGUE###Pity it wasn't ###CHAR25### -'' The bell rang at that moment, which was lucky; at Malfoy's last words, ###CHAR68### had leapt off ###CHAR68###'s stool, and in the scramble to collect bags and books, ###CHAR68###'s attempts to reach ###CHAR50### went unnoticed. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Let me at him,'' ###CHAR68### growled as ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR28### hung onto ###CHAR68###'s arms. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I don't care, I don't need my wand, I'm going to kill him with my bare hands -'' ``Hurry up, I've got to take you all to Herbology,'' barked ###CHAR63### over the class's heads, and off they marched, with ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR68###, and Dean bringing up the rear, ###CHAR68### still trying to get loose. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It was only safe to let go of ###CHAR68### when ###CHAR63### had seen them out of the castle and they were making their way across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The Herbology class was very subdued; there were now two missing from their number, ###CHAR100### and ###CHAR25###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Professor Sprout set them all to work pruning the Abyssinian Shrivelfigs. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### went to tip an armful of withered stalks onto the compost heap and found himself face-to-face with ###CHAR40### . 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR40### took a deep breath and said, very formally, ``I just want to say, ###CHAR68###, that I'm sorry I ever suspected you. 
I know you'd never attack ###CHAR25### , and I apologize for all the stuff I said. 
###DIALOGUE###We're all in the same boat now, and, well -'' ###CHAR40### held out a pudgy hand, and ###CHAR68### shook it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR40### and ###CHAR40###'s friend ###CHAR36### came to work at the same Shrivelfig as ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``That Draco Malfoy character,'' said ###CHAR40###, breaking off dead twigs, ``he seems very pleased about all this, doesn't he? 
###DIALOGUE###D'you know, I think he might be ###CHAR45###'s heir.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``That's clever of you,'' said ###CHAR68###, who didn't seem to have forgiven ###CHAR40### as readily as ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Do you think it's Malfoy, ###CHAR68###?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR40### asked. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``No,'' said ###CHAR68###, so firmly that ###CHAR40### and ###CHAR36### stared. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###A second later, ###CHAR68### spotted something. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Several large spiders were scuttling over the ground on the other side of the glass, moving in an unnaturally straight line as though taking the shortest route to a prearranged meeting. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### hit ###CHAR68### over the hand with ###CHAR68###'s pruning shears. 
###DIALOGUE###``Ouch! 
###DIALOGUE###What're you -'' ###CHAR68### pointed out the spiders, following their progress with ###CHAR68###'s eyes screwed up against the sun. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Oh, yeah,'' said ###CHAR68###, trying, and failing, to look pleased. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But we can't follow them now -'' ###CHAR40### and ###CHAR36### were listening curiously. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###'s eyes narrowed as ###CHAR68### focused on the spiders. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###If they pursued their fixed course, there could be no doubt about where they would end up. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Looks like they're heading for the Forbidden Forest ...'' And ###CHAR68### looked even unhappier about that. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###At the end of the lesson Professor Sprout escorted the class to their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### lagged behind the others so they could talk out of earshot. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We'll have to use the Invisibility Cloak again,'' ###CHAR68### told ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``We can take ###CHAR58### with us. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR58###'s used to going into the forest with ###CHAR22###, ###CHAR58### might be some help.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Right,'' said ###CHAR68###, who was twirling ###CHAR68###'s wand nervously in ###CHAR68###'s fingers. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Er - aren't there - aren't there supposed to be werewolves in the forest?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### added as they took their usual places at the back of ###CHAR73###'s classroom. 
###DIALOGUE###Preferring not to answer that question, ###CHAR68### said, ``There are good things in there, too. 
The centaurs are all right, and the unicorns ... ###CHAR68### had never been into the Forbidden Forest before. 
###CHAR68### had entered it only once and had hoped never to do so again. 
###CHAR73### bounded into the room and the class stared at ###CHAR68###. 
Every other teacher in the place was looking grimmer than usual, but ###CHAR73### appeared nothing short of buoyant. 
###DIALOGUE###``Come now,'' ###CHAR68### cried, beaming around ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Why all these long faces?'' 
People swapped exasperated looks, but nobody answered. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Don't you people realize,'' said ###CHAR73###, speaking slowly, as though they were all a bit dim, ``the danger has passed! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The culprit has been taken away -'' ``Says who?'' 
said ###CHAR28### loudly. 
###DIALOGUE###``My dear young man, the Minister of Magic wouldn't have taken ###CHAR22### if he hadn't been one hundred percent sure that he was guilty,'' said ###CHAR73###, in the tone of someone explaining that one and one made two. 
###DIALOGUE###``Oh, yes he would,'' said ###CHAR68###, even more loudly than ###CHAR28###. 
###DIALOGUE###``I flatter myself I know a touch more about ###CHAR22###'s arrest than you do, ###CHAR84### ,'' said ###CHAR73### in a self-satisfied tone. 
###CHAR68### started to say that ###CHAR68### didn't think so, somehow, but stopped in midsentence when ###CHAR68### kicked ###CHAR68### hard under the desk. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We weren't there, remember?'' 
###CHAR68### muttered. 
But ###CHAR73###'s disgusting cheeriness, ###CHAR68###'s hints that ###CHAR68### had always thought ###CHAR22### was no good, ###CHAR68###'s confidence that the whole business was now at an end, irritated ###CHAR68### so much that ###CHAR68### yearned to throw Gadding with Ghouls right in ###CHAR73###'s stupid face. 
Instead ###CHAR73### contented himself with scrawling a note to ###CHAR68###: Let's do it tonight. 
###CHAR68### read the message, swallowed hard, and looked sideways at the empty seat usually filled by ###CHAR25###. 
The sight seemed to stiffen ###CHAR68###'s resolve, and ###CHAR68### nodded. 
The Gryffindor common room was always very crowded these days, because from six o'clock onward the Gryffindors had no - where else to go. 
They also had plenty to talk about, with the result that the common room often didn't empty until past midnight. 
###CHAR68### went to get the Invisibility Cloak out of ###CHAR68###'s trunk right after dinner, and spent the evening sitting on it, waiting for the room to clear. 
###CHAR55### and ###CHAR19### challenged ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### to a few games of Exploding Snap, and ###CHAR76### sat watching them, very subdued in ###CHAR25###'s usual chair. 
###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### kept losing on purpose, trying to finish the games quickly, but even so, it was well past midnight when ###CHAR55###, ###CHAR19###, and ###CHAR76### finally went to bed. 
###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### waited for the distant sounds of two dormitory doors closing before seizing the cloak, throwing it over themselves, and climbing through the portrait hole. 
It was another difficult journey through the castle, dodging all the teachers. 
###DIALOGUE###At last they reached the entrance hall, slid back the lock on the oak front doors, squeezed between them, trying to stop any creaking, and stepped out into the moonlit grounds. ''
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###`Course,'' said ###CHAR68### abruptly as they strode across the black grass, ``we might get to the forest and find there's nothing to follow. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Those spiders might not've been going there at all. 
###DIALOGUE###I know it looked like they were moving in that sort of general direction, but...'' ###CHAR68###'s voice trailed away hopefully. 
They reached ###CHAR22###'s house, sad and sorry-looking with its blank windows. 
When ###CHAR68### pushed the door open, ###CHAR58### went mad with joy at the sight of them. 
Worried ###CHAR68### might wake everyone at the castle with ###CHAR68###'s deep, booming barks, they hastily fed ###CHAR68### treacle fudge from a tin on the mantelpiece, which glued ###CHAR68###'s teeth together. 
###CHAR68### left the Invisibility Cloak on ###CHAR22###'s table. 
There would be no need for it in the pitch-dark forest. 
###DIALOGUE###``C'mon, ###CHAR58###, we're going for a walk,'' said ###CHAR68###, patting ###CHAR68###'s leg, and ###CHAR58### bounded happily out of the house behind them, dashed to the edge of the forest, and lifted ###CHAR68###'s leg against a large sycamore tree. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR68### took out ###CHAR68###'s wand, murmured, ``Lumos!'' 
and a tiny light appeared at the end of it, just enough to let them watch the path for signs of spiders. 
###DIALOGUE###``Good thinking,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``Id light mine, too, but you know - it'd probably blow up or something ...'' ###CHAR68### tapped ###CHAR68### on the shoulder, pointing at the grass. 
Two solitary spiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the shade of the trees. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Okay,'' ###CHAR68### sighed as though resigned to the worst, ``I'm ready. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Let's go.'' 
So, with ###CHAR58### scampering around them, sniffing tree roots and leaves, they entered the forest. 
By the glow of ###CHAR68###'s wand, they followed the steady trickle of spiders moving along the path. 
They walked behind them for about twenty minutes, not speaking, listening hard for noises other than breaking twigs and rustling leaves. 
Then, when the trees had become thicker than ever, so that the stars overhead were no longer visible, and ###CHAR68###'s wand shone alone in the sea of dark, they saw their spider guides leaving the path. 
###CHAR68### paused, trying to see where the spiders were going, but everything outside ###CHAR68###'s little sphere ofnever been this deep into the forest before. 
###CHAR68### could vividly remember ###CHAR22### advising ###CHAR68### not to leave the forest path last time ###CHAR68###'d been in here. 
But ###CHAR22### was miles away now, probably sitting in a cell in Azkaban, and ###CHAR68### had also said to follow the spiders. 
Something wet touched ###CHAR68###'s hand and ###CHAR68### jumped backward, crushing Rods foot, but it was only ###CHAR58###'s nose. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What d'you reckon?'' 
###CHAR68### said to ###CHAR68###, whose eyes ###CHAR68### could just make out, reflecting the light from ###CHAR68###'s wand. 
###DIALOGUE###``We've come this far,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
So they followed the darting shadows of the spiders into the trees. 
They couldn't move very quickly now; there were tree roots and stumps in their way, barely visible in the near blackness. 
###CHAR68### could feel ###CHAR58###'s hot breath on ###CHAR68###'s hand. 
More than once, they had to stop, so that ###CHAR68### could crouch down and find the spiders in the wandlight. 
They walked for what seemed like at least half an hour, their robes snagging on low-slung branches and brambles. 
After a while, they noticed that the ground seemed to be sloping downward, though the trees were as thick as ever. 
Then ###CHAR58### suddenly let loose a great, echoing bark, making both ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### jump out of their skins. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What?'' 
said ###CHAR68### loudly, looking around into the pitch-dark, and gripping ###CHAR68###'s elbow very hard. 
###DIALOGUE###``There's something moving over there,'' ###CHAR68### breathed. 
###DIALOGUE###``Listen ... sounds like something big ...'' They listened. 
Some distance to their right, the something big was snapping branches as it carved a path through the trees. 
###DIALOGUE###``Oh, no,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``Oh, no, oh, no, oh -'' ``Shut up,'' said ###CHAR68### frantically. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It'll hear you.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Hear me?'' 
said ###CHAR68### in an unnaturally high voice. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It's already heard ###CHAR58###!'' 
The darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs as they stood, terrified, waiting. 
There was a strange rumbling noise and then silence. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What d'you think it's doing?'' 
said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``Probably getting ready to pounce,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
They waited, shivering, hardly daring to move. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``D'you think it's gone?'' 
###CHAR68### whispered. 
###DIALOGUE###``Dunno -'' Then, to their right, came a sudden blaze of light, so bright in the darkness that both of them flung up their hands to shield their eyes. 
###CHAR58### yelped and tried to run, but got lodged in a tangle of thorns and yelped even louder. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR68###!'' 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR68### shouted, ###CHAR68###'s voice breaking with relief ``###CHAR68###, it's our car!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Come on!'' 
###CHAR68### blundered after ###CHAR68### toward the light, stumbling and tripping, and a moment later they had emerged into a clearing. 
###CHAR84### 's car was standing, empty, in the middle of a circle of thick trees under a roof of dense branches, its headlights ablaze. 
As ###CHAR68### walked, open-mouthed, toward it, it moved slowly toward ###CHAR68###, exactly like a large, turquoise dog greeting its owner. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It's been here all the time!'' 
said ###CHAR68### delightedly, walking around the car. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Look at it. 
###DIALOGUE###The forest's turned it wild ...'' The sides of the car were scratched and smeared with mud. 
Apparently it had taken to trundling around the forest on its own. 
###CHAR58### didn't seem at all keen on it; ###CHAR58### kept close to ###CHAR68###, who could feel ###CHAR68### quivering. 
###CHAR68###'s breathing slowing down again, ###CHAR68### stuffed ###CHAR68###'s wand back into ###CHAR68###'s robes. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``And we thought it was going to attack us!'' 
said ###CHAR68###, leaning against the car and patting it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I wondered where it had gone!'' 
###CHAR68### squinted around on the floodlit ground for signs of more spiders, but they had all scuttled away from the glare of the headlights. 
###DIALOGUE###``We've lost the trail,'' ###CHAR68### said. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``C'mon, let's go and find them.'' 
###CHAR68### didn't speak. 
###CHAR68### didn't move. 
###CHAR68###'s eyes were fixed on a point some ten feet above the forest floor, right behind ###CHAR68###. 
###CHAR68###'s face was livid with terror. 
###CHAR68### didn't even have time to turn around. 
There was a loud clicking noise and suddenly ###CHAR68### felt something long and hairy seize ###CHAR68### around the middle and lift ###CHAR68### off the ground, so that ###CHAR68### was hanging facedown. 
Struggling, terrified, ###CHAR68### heard more clicking, and saw ###CHAR68###'s legs leave the ground, too, heard ###CHAR58### whimpering and howling - next moment, ###CHAR58### was being swept away into the dark trees. 
Head hanging, ###CHAR68### saw that what had hold of ###CHAR68### was marching on six immensely long, hairy legs, the front two clutching ###CHAR68### tightly below a pair of shining black pincers. 
Behind ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR68### could hear another of the creatures, no doubt carrying ###CHAR68###. 
They were moving into the very heart of the forest. 
###CHAR68### could hear ###CHAR58### fighting to free himself from a third monster, whining loudly, but ###CHAR68### couldn't have yelled even if ###CHAR68### had wanted to; ###CHAR68### seemed to have left ###CHAR68###'s voice back with the car in the clearing. 
###CHAR68### never knew how long ###CHAR68### was in the creature's clutches; ###CHAR68### only knew that the darkness suddenly lifted enough for ###CHAR68### to see that the leaf-strewn ground was now swarming with spiders. 
Craning ###CHAR68###'s neck sideways, ###CHAR68### realized that they had reached the ridge of a vast hollow, a hollow that had been cleared of trees, so that the stars shone brightly onto the worst scene ###CHAR68### had ever laid eyes on. 
Spiders. 
Not tiny spiders like those surging over the leaves below. 
Spiders the size of carthorses, eight-eyed, eight-legged, black, hairy, gigantic. 
The massive specimen that was carrying ###CHAR68### made its way down the steep slope toward a misty, domed web in the very center of the hollow, while its fellows closed in all around it, clicking their pincers excitedly at the sight of its load. 
Harry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released him. 
###CHAR68### and ###CHAR58### thudded down next to ###CHAR68###. 
###CHAR58### wasn't howling anymore, but cowering silently on the spot. 
###CHAR68### looked exactly like ###CHAR68### felt. 
###CHAR68###'s mouth was stretched wide in a kind of silent scream and ###CHAR68###'s eyes were popping. 
###CHAR68### suddenly realized that the spider that had dropped ###CHAR68### was saying something. 
It had been hard to tell, because ###CHAR68### clicked ###CHAR68###'s pincers with every word ###CHAR68### spoke. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Aragog!'' 
it called. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Aragog!'' 
And from the middle of the misty, domed web, a spider the size of a small elephant emerged, very slowly. 
There was gray in the black of ###CHAR68###'s body and legs, and each of the eyes on ###CHAR68###'s ugly, pincered head was milky white. 
###CHAR68### was blind. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What is it?'' 
###CHAR68### said, clicking ###CHAR68###'s pincers rapidly. 
###DIALOGUE###``Men,'' clicked the spider who had caught ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Is it Hagrid?'' 
said ###CHAR82###, moving closer, ###CHAR68###'s eight milky eyes wandering vaguely. 
###DIALOGUE###``Strangers,'' clicked the spider who had brought ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``Kill them,'' clicked Aragog fretfully. 
###DIALOGUE###``I was sleeping ...'' ``We're friends of ###CHAR22###'s,'' ###CHAR68### shouted. 
###CHAR68###'s heart seemed to have left ###CHAR68###'s chest to pound in ###CHAR68###'s throat. 
Click, click, click went the pincers of the spiders all around the hollow. 
###CHAR82### paused. 
###DIALOGUE###``###CHAR22### has never sent men into our hollow before,'' ###CHAR68### said slowly. 
###DIALOGUE###``Hagrid's in trouble,'' said ###CHAR68###, breathing very fast. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``That's why we've come.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``In trouble?'' 
said the aged spider, and ###CHAR68### thought ###CHAR68### heard concern beneath the clicking pincers. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But why has he sent you?'' 
###CHAR68### thought of getting to ###CHAR68###'s feet but decided against it; ###CHAR68### didn't think ###CHAR68###'s legs would support ###CHAR68###. 
So ###CHAR68### spoke from the ground, as calmly as ###CHAR68### could. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``They think,, up at the school, that ###CHAR22###'s been setting a a - something on students. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They've taken him to Azkaban.'' 
###CHAR82### clicked ###CHAR68###'s pincers furiously, and all around the hollow the sound was echoed by the crowd of spiders; it was like applause, except applause didn't usually make ###CHAR68### feel sick with fear. 
###DIALOGUE###``But that was years ago,'' said ###CHAR82### fretfully. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Years and years ago. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I remember it well. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###That's why they made him leave the school. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They believed that I was the monster that dwells in what they call the Chamber of Secrets. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They thought that ###CHAR22### had opened the Chamber and set me free.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``And you ... you didn't come from the Chamber of Secrets?'' 
said ###CHAR68###, who could feel cold sweat on ###CHAR68###'s forehead. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I!'' 
said ###CHAR82###, clicking angrily. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I was not born in the castle. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I come from a distant land. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###A traveler gave me to ###CHAR22### when I was an egg. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR22### was only a boy, but he cared for me, hidden in a cupboard in the castle, feeding me on scraps from the table. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR22### is my good friend, and a good man. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###When I was discovered, and blamed for the death of a girl, he protected me. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I have lived here in the forest ever since, where ###CHAR22### still visits me. 
###DIALOGUE###He even found me a wife, Mosag, and you see how our family has grown, all through ###CHAR22###'s goodness ...'' ###CHAR68### summoned what remained of ###CHAR68###'s courage. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``So you never - never attacked anyone?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Never,'' croaked the old spider. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It would have been my instinct, but out of respect for ###CHAR22###, I never harmed a human. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The body of the girl who was killed was discovered in a bathroom. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I never saw any part of the castle but the cupboard in which I grew up. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Our kind like the dark and the quiet ...'' ``But then ... Do you know what did kill that girl?'' 
said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``Because whatever it is, it's back and attacking people again -'' ###CHAR68###'s words were drowned by a loud outbreak of clicking and the rustling of many long legs shifting angrily; large black shapes shifted all around ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``The thing that lives in the castle,'' said ###CHAR82###, ``is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Well do I remember how I pleaded with ###CHAR22### to let me go, when I sensed the beast moving about the school.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What is it?'' 
said ###CHAR68### urgently. 
More loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed to be closing in. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We do not speak of it!'' 
said ###CHAR82### fiercely. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We do not name it! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I never even told ###CHAR22### the name of that dread creature, though ###CHAR22### asked me, many times.'' 
###CHAR68### didn't want to press the subject, not with the spiders pressing closer on all sides. 
###CHAR82### seemed to be tired of tamng. 
###CHAR68### was backing slowly into ###CHAR68###'s domed web, but ###CHAR68###'s fellow spiders continued to inch slowly toward ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``We'll just go, then,'' ###CHAR68### called desperately to Aragog, hearing leaves rustling behind ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Go?'' 
said ###CHAR82### slowly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I think not ...'' ``But - but -'' ``My sons and daughters do not harm ###CHAR22###, on my command. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###But I cannot deny them fresh meat, when it wanders so willingly into our midst. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Good-bye, friend of ###CHAR22###.'' 
###CHAR68### spun around. 
Feet away, towering above ###CHAR68###, was a solid wall of spiders, clicking, their many eyes gleaming in their ugly black heads. 
Even as ###CHAR68### reached for ###CHAR68###'s wand, ###CHAR68### knew it was no good, there were too many of them, but as ###CHAR68### tried to stand, ready to die fighting, a loud, long note sounded, and a blaze of light flamed through the hollow. 
###CHAR84### 's car was thundering down the slope, headlights glaring, its horn screeching, knocking spiders aside; several were thrown onto their backs, their endless legs waving in the air. 
The car screeched to a halt in front of ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### and the doors flew open. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Get Fang!'' 
###CHAR68### yelled, diving into the front seat; ###CHAR68### seized the boarhound around the middle and threw ###CHAR68###, yelping, into the back of the car - the doors slammed shut - ###CHAR68### didn't touch the accelerator but the car didn't need ###CHAR68###; the engine roared and they were off, hitting more spiders. 
They sped up the slope, out of the hollow, and they were soon crashing through the forest, branches whipping the windows as the car wound its way cleverly through the widest gaps, following a path it obviously knew. 
###CHAR68### looked sideways at ###CHAR68###. 
###CHAR68###'s mouth was still open in the silent scream, but ###CHAR68###'s eyes weren't popping anymore. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Are you okay?'' 
###CHAR68### stared straight ahead, unable to speak. 
They smashed their way through the undergrowth, ###CHAR58### howling loudly in the back seat, and ###CHAR68### saw the side mirror snap off as they squeezed past a large oak. 
After ten noisy, rocky minutes, the trees thinned, and ###CHAR68### could again see patches of sky. 
The car stopped so suddenly that they were nearly thrown into the windshield. 
They had reached the edge of the forest. 
###CHAR58### flung himself at the window in ###CHAR58###'s anxiety to get out, and when ###CHAR68### opened the door, ###CHAR68### shot off through the trees to ###CHAR22###'s house, tail between ###CHAR68###'s legs. 
###CHAR68### got out too, and after a minute or so, ###CHAR68### seemed to regain the feeling in ###CHAR68###'s limbs and followed, still stiff-necked and staring. 
###CHAR68### gave the car a grateful pat as it reversed back into the forest and disappeared from view. 
###CHAR68### went back into ###CHAR22###'s cabin to get the Invisibility Cloak. 
###CHAR58### was trembling under a blanket in ###CHAR58###'s basket. 
When ###CHAR68### got outside again, ###CHAR68### found ###CHAR68### being violently sick in the pumpkin patch. 
###DIALOGUE###``Follow the spiders,'' said ###CHAR68### weakly, wiping ###CHAR68###'s mouth on ###CHAR68###'s sleeve. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I'll never forgive ###CHAR22###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###We're lucky to be alive.'' 
###DIALOGUE###``I bet he thought Aragog wouldn't hurt friends of his,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``That's exactly ###CHAR22###'s problem!'' 
said ###CHAR68###, thumping the wall of the cabin. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``He always thinks monsters aren't as bad as they're made out, and look where it's got him! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###A cell in Azkaban!'' 
###CHAR68### was shivering uncontrollably now. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What was the point of sending us in there? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###What have we found out, Id like to know?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``That ###CHAR22### never opened the Chamber of Secrets,'' said ###CHAR68###, throwing the cloak over ###CHAR68### and prodding ###CHAR68### in the arm to make ###CHAR68### walk. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``He was innocent.'' 
###CHAR68### gave a loud snort. 
Evidently, hatching ###CHAR82### in a cupboard wasn't ###CHAR68###'s idea of being innocent. 
As the castle loomed nearer ###CHAR68### twitched the cloak to make sure their feet were hidden, then pushed the creaking front doors ajar. 
They walked carefully back across the entrance hall and up the marble staircase, holding their breath as they passed corridors where watchful sentries were walking. 
At last they reached the safety of the Gryffindor common room, where the fire had burned itself into glowing ash. 
They took off the cloak and climbed the winding stair to their dormitory. 
###CHAR68### fell onto ###CHAR68###'s bed without bothering to get undressed. 
###CHAR68###, however, didn't feel very sleepy. 
###CHAR68### sat on the edge of ###CHAR68###'s fourposter, thinking hard about everything ###CHAR82### had said. 
The creature that was lurking somewhere in the castle, ###CHAR68### thought, sounded like a sort of monster ###CHAR21### - even other monsters didn't want to name it. 
But ###CHAR21### and ###CHAR68### were no closer to finding out what it was, or how it Petrified its victims. 
Even ###CHAR22### had never known what was in the Chamber of Secrets. 
###CHAR68### swung ###CHAR68###'s legs up onto ###CHAR68###'s bed and leaned back against ###CHAR68###'s pillows, watching the moon glinting at ###CHAR68### through the tower window. 
###CHAR68### couldn't see what else they could do. 
They had hit dead ends everywhere. 
###CHAR27### had caught the wrong person, the Heir of Slytherin had got off, and no one could tell whether it was the same person, or a different one, who had opened the Chamber this time. 
There was nobody else to ask. 
###CHAR68### lay down, still thinking about what ###CHAR82### had said. 
###CHAR68### was becoming drowsy when what seemed like their very last hope occurred to ###CHAR68###, and ###CHAR68### suddenly sat bolt upright. 
###DIALOGUE###``###CHAR68###,'' ###CHAR68### hissed through the dark, ``###CHAR68### -'' ###CHAR68### woke with a yelp like ###CHAR58###'s, stared wildly around, and saw ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR68### -that girl who died. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR82### said she was found in a bathroom,'' said ###CHAR68###, ignoring ###CHAR92###'s snufing snores from the corner. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What if she never left the bathroom? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###What if she's still there?'' 
###CHAR68### rubbed ###CHAR68###'s eyes, frowning through the moonlight. 
And then ###CHAR68### understood, too. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You don't think - not Moaning Myrtle?'' 
###DIALOGUE###A ll those times we were in that bathroom, and ###CHAR82### was just three toilets away,'' said ###CHAR68### bitterly at breakfast next day, ``and we could've asked her, and now...'' It had been hard enough trying to look for spiders. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Escaping their teachers long enough to sneak into a girls' bathroom, the girls' bathroom, moreover, right next to the scene of the first attack, was going to be almost impossible. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###But something happened in their first lesson, Transfiguration, that drove the Chamber of Secrets out of their minds for the first time in weeks. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Ten minutes into the class, Professor ###CHAR96### told them that their exams would start on the first of June, one week from today. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Exams?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###howled ###CHAR4### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We're still getting exams?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There was a loud bang behind ###CHAR68### as ###CHAR92### 's wand slipped, vanishing one of the legs on ###CHAR68###'s desk. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Professor ###CHAR96### restored it with a wave of ###CHAR92###'s own wand, and turned, frowning, to ###CHAR4###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``The whole point of keeping the school open at this time is for you to receive your education,'' ###CHAR92### said sternly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``The exams will therefore take place as usual, and I trust you are all studying hard.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Studying hard! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It had never occurred to ###CHAR68### that there would be exams with the castle in this state. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There was a great deal of mutinous muttering around the room, which made Professor ###CHAR96### scowl even more darkly. 
###DIALOGUE###``Professor ###CHAR94###'s instructions were to keep the school running as normally as possible, she said. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``And that, I need hardly point out, means finding out how much you have learned this year. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### looked down at the pair of white rabbits ###CHAR68### was supposed to be turning into slippers. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###What had ###CHAR68### learned so far this year? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### couldn't seem to think of anything that would be useful in an exam. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### looked as though ###CHAR68###'d just been told ###CHAR68### had to go and live in the Forbidden Forest. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Can you imagine me taking exams with this?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###he asked ###CHAR68###, holding up ###CHAR68###'s wand, which had just started whistling loudly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Three days before their first exam, Professor ###CHAR96### made another announcement at breakfast. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I have good news,'' ###CHAR92### said, and the Great Hall, instead of falling silent, erupted. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR94###'s coming back!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###several people yelled joyfully. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You've caught the Heir of Slytherin!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###squealed a girl at the Ravenclaw table. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Quidditch matches are back on!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###roared ###CHAR43### excitedly. 
###DIALOGUE###When the hubbub had subsided, Professor ###CHAR96### said, ``Professor Sprout has informed me that the Mandrakes are ready for cutting at last. 
Tonight, we will be able to revive those people who have been Petrified. 
I need hardly remind you all that one of them may well be able to tell us who, or what, attacked them. 
###DIALOGUE###I am hopeful that this dreadful year will end with our catching the culprit.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There was an explosion of cheering. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### looked over at the Slytherin table and wasn't at all surprised to see that ###CHAR0### hadn't joined in. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###, however, was looking happier than ###CHAR68###'d looked in days. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It won't matter that we never asked Myrtle, then!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### said to ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``Hermione'll probably have all the answers when they wake her up! 
Mind you, she'll go crazy when she finds out we've got exams in three days' time. 
She hasn't studied. 
###DIALOGUE###It might be kinder to leave her where she is till they're over.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Just then, ###CHAR76### came over and sat down next to ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR76### looked tense and nervous, and ###CHAR68### noticed that ###CHAR76###'s hands were twisting in ###CHAR76###'s lap. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What's up?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68###, helping himself to more porridge. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR76### didn't say anything, but glanced up and down the Gryffindor table with a scared look on ###CHAR76###'s face that reminded ###CHAR68### of someone, though ###CHAR68### couldn't think who. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Spit it out,'' said ###CHAR68###, watching ###CHAR76###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### suddenly realized who ###CHAR76### looked like. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR76### was rocking backward and forward slightly in ###CHAR76###'s chair, exactly like ###CHAR48### did when ###CHAR68### was teetering on the edge of revealing forbidden information. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I've got to tell you something,'' ###CHAR76### mumbled, carefully not looking at ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What is it?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR76### looked as though ###CHAR76### couldn't find the right words. 
###DIALOGUE###``What?
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR76### opened ###CHAR76###'s mouth, but no sound came out. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### leaned forward and spoke quietly, so that only ###CHAR76### and ###CHAR68### could hear ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``Is it something about the Chamber of Secrets? 
Have you seen something? 
###DIALOGUE###Someone acting oddly?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR76### drew a deep breath and, at that precise moment, ###CHAR70### appeared, looking tired and wan. 
###DIALOGUE###``If you've finished eating, I'll take that seat, ###CHAR76###. 
###DIALOGUE###I'm starving, I've only just come off patrol duty.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR76### jumped up as though ###CHAR76###'s chair had just been electrified, gave ###CHAR70### a fleeting, frightened look, and scampered away. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR70### sat down and grabbed a mug from the center of the table. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Percy!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68### angrily. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR76### was just about to tell us some-' thing important!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Halfway through a gulp of tea, ###CHAR70### choked. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What sort of thing?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR70### said, coughing. 
###DIALOGUE###``I just asked ###CHAR76###'s if ###CHAR76###'d seen anything odd, and ###CHAR76### started to say ``Oh - that - that's nothing to do with the Chamber of Secrets,'' said ###CHAR70### at once. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``How do you know?'' 
said ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR68###'s eyebrows raised. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Well, er, if you must know, ###CHAR76###, er, walked in on me the other day when I was - well, never mind - the point is, ###CHAR76### spot ted me doing something and I, um, I asked ###CHAR76### not to mention it to anybody. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I must say, I did think ###CHAR76###'d keep ###CHAR76###'s word. 
###DIALOGUE###It's nothing, really, Id just rather -'' ###CHAR68### had never seen ###CHAR70### look so uncomfortable. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What were you doing, ###CHAR70###?'' 
said ###CHAR68###, grinning. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Go on, tell us, we won't laugh.'' 
###CHAR70### didn't smile back. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Pass me those rolls, ###CHAR68###, I'm starving.'' 
###CHAR68### knew the whole mystery might be solved tomorrow without their help, but ###CHAR68### wasn't about to pass up a chance to speak to Myrtle if it turned up - and to ###CHAR68###'s delight it did, midmorning, when they were being led to History of Magic by ###CHAR73### . 
###CHAR73###, who had so often assured them that all danger had passed, only to be proved wrong right away, was now wholeheartedly convinced that it was hardly worth the trouble to see them safely down the corridors. 
###CHAR73###'s hair wasn't as sleek as usual; it seemed ###CHAR73### had been up most of the night, patrolling the fourth floor. 
###DIALOGUE###``Mark my words,'' ###CHAR73### said, ushering them around a corner. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``The first words out of those poor Petrified people's mouths will be It was Hagrid.' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Frankly, I'm astounded Professor ###CHAR96### thinks all these security measures are necessary.'' 
###DIALOGUE###-LRB-ti agree, sir,'' said ###CHAR68###, making ###CHAR68### drop ###CHAR68###'s books in surprise. 
###DIALOGUE###``Thank you, ###CHAR68###, said ###CHAR73### graciously while they waited for a long line of Hufflepuffs to pass. 
###DIALOGUE###``I mean, we teachers have quite enough to be getting on with, without walking students to classes and standing guard all night ...'' ``That's right,'' said ###CHAR68###, catching on. 
###DIALOGUE###``Why don't you leave us here, sir, we've only got one more corridor to go -'' ``You know, ###CHAR55###, I think I will,'' said ###CHAR73###. 
###DIALOGUE###``I really should go and prepare my next class -'' And ###CHAR73### hurried off. 
###DIALOGUE###``Prepare ###CHAR55###'s class,'' ###CHAR68### sneered after ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Gone to curl ###CHAR55###'s hair, more like.'' 
They let the rest of the Gryffindors draw ahead of them, then darted down a side passage and hurried off toward Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. 
But just as they were congratulating each other on their brilliant scheme ``###CHAR54###! 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR55###! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###What are you doing?'' 
It was Professor ###CHAR96###, and her mouth was the thinnest of thin lines. 
###DIALOGUE###``We were -we were-'' ###CHAR68### stammered. 
###DIALOGUE###``We were going to - to go and see -'' ``Hermione,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###CHAR68### and Professor ###CHAR96### both looked at ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``We haven't seen her for ages, Professor,'' ###CHAR68### went on hurriedly, treading on ###CHAR68###'s foot, ``and we thought we'd sneak into the hospital wing, you know, and tell her the Mandrakes are nearly ready and, er, not to worry -'' Professor ###CHAR96### was still staring at him, and for a moment, ###CHAR68### thought she was going to explode, but when she spoke, it was in a strangely croaky voice. 
###DIALOGUE###``Of course,'' she said, and ###CHAR68###, amazed, saw a tear glistening in her beady eye. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Of course, I realize this has all been hardest on the friends of those who have been ... I quite understand. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Yes, ###CHAR54###, of course you may visit ###CHAR25### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I will inform Professor ###CHAR56### where you've gone. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Tell Madam Pomfrey I have given my permission.'' 
###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### walked away, hardly daring to believe that they'd avoided detention. 
As they turned the corner, they distinctly heard Professor ###CHAR96### blow her nose. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``That,'' said ###CHAR68### fervently, ``was the best story you've ever come up with.'' 
They had no choice now but to go to the hospital wing and tell ###CHAR98### that they had Professor ###CHAR96###'s permission to visit ###CHAR25###. 
###CHAR98### let them in, but reluctantly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``There's just no point talking to a Petrified. 
###DIALOGUE###person,'' ###CHAR98### said, and they had to admit ###CHAR98### had a point when they'd taken their seats next to ###CHAR25###. 
It was plain that ###CHAR25### didn't have the faintest inkling that ###CHAR25### had visitors, and that they might just as well tell ###CHAR25###'s bedside cabinet not to worry for all the good it would do. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Wonder if ###CHAR25### did see the attacker, though?'' 
said ###CHAR68###, looking sadly at ###CHAR25###'s rigid face. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Because if he sneaked up on them all, no one'll ever know . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###... But ###CHAR68### wasn't looking at ###CHAR25###'s face. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### was more interested in ###CHAR25###'s right hand. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It lay clenched on top of ###CHAR25###'s blankets, and bending closer, ###CHAR68### saw that a piece of paper was scrunched inside ###CHAR25###'s fist. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Making sure that ###CHAR98### was nowhere near, ###CHAR68### pointed this out to ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``TG and get it out,'' ###CHAR68### whispered, shifting ###CHAR68###'s chair so that ###CHAR68### blocked ###CHAR68### from Madam Pomfrey's view. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It was no easy task. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR25###'s hand was clamped so tightly around the paper that ###CHAR68### was sure ###CHAR68### was going to tear it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###While ###CHAR68### kept watch ###CHAR68### tugged and twisted, and at last, after several tense minutes, the paper came free. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It was a page torn from a very old library book. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### smoothed it out eagerly and ###CHAR68### leaned close to read it, too. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Of the many fearsome beasts and monsters that roam our land, there is none more curious or more deadly than the Basilisk, known also as the King of Serpents. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###This snake, which may reach gigantic size and live many hundreds of years, is born from a chicken's egg, hatched beneath a toad. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Its methods of killing are most wondrous, for aside from its deadly and venomous fangs, the Basilisk has a murderous stare, and all who are fixed with the beam of its eye shall suffer instant death. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Spiders flee before the Basilisk, for it is their mortal enemy, and the Basilisk flees only from the crowing of the rooster, which is fatal to it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###And beneath this, a single word had been written, in a hand ###CHAR68### recognized as ###CHAR25###'s. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Pipes. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It was as though somebody had just flicked a light on in ###CHAR68###'s brain. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR68###,'' ###CHAR68### breathed. 
###DIALOGUE###``This is it. 
This is the answer. 
The monster in the Chamber's a basilisk - a giant serpent! 
That why I've been hearing that voice all over the place, and nobody else has heard it. 
###DIALOGUE###It's because I understand Parseltongue ...'' Harry looked up at the beds around him. 
###DIALOGUE###``The basilisk kills people by looking at them. 
But no one's died - because no one looked it straight in the eye. 
###CHAR66### saw it through ###CHAR66###'s camera. 
The basilisk burned up all the film inside it, but ###CHAR66### just got Petrified. 
###CHAR100### ... ###CHAR100### must've seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick! 
###CHAR29### got the full blast of it, but ###CHAR29### couldn't die again ... and ###CHAR25### and that Ravenclaw prefect were found with a mirror next to them. 
###CHAR25### had just realized the monster was a basilisk. 
I bet you anything ###CHAR25### warned the first person ###CHAR25### met to look around corners with a mirror first! 
###DIALOGUE###And that girl pulled out her mirror - and -'' Rods jaw had dropped. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``And ###CHAR34### ?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###he whispered eagerly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### thought hard, picturing the scene on the night of Halloween. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``The water...'' ###CHAR68### said slowly. 
###DIALOGUE###``The flood from Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. 
###DIALOGUE###I bet you ###CHAR34### only saw the reflection ...'' ###CHAR68### scanned the page in ###CHAR68###'s hand eagerly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The more ###CHAR68### looked at it, the more it made sense. '' 
. 
. 
###DIALOGUE###The crowing of the rooster ... is fatal to it''! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###he read aloud. 
###DIALOGUE###``Hagrid's roosters were killed! 
The Heir of ###CHAR45### didn't want one anywhere near the castle once the Chamber was opened! 
Spidersflee before it.
! 
###DIALOGUE###It all fits!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But how's the basilisk been getting around the place?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``A giant snake ... Someone would've seen...'' ###CHAR68###, however, pointed at the word ###CHAR25### had scribbled at the foot of the page. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Pipes,'' ###CHAR68### said. 
###DIALOGUE###``Pipes ... ###CHAR68###, it's been using the plumbing. 
###DIALOGUE###I've been hearing that voice inside the walls ...'' ###CHAR68### suddenly grabbed ###CHAR68###'s arm. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``The entrance to the Chamber of Secrets!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### said hoarsely. 
###DIALOGUE###``What if it's a bathroom? 
What if it's in -'' `= Moaning Myrtle's bathroom, ``said ###CHAR68###. 
They sat there, excitement coursing through them, hardly able to believe it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``This means,'' said ###CHAR68###, ``I can't be the only Parselmouth in the school. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The Heir of ###CHAR45###'s one, too. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###That's how ###CHAR45###'s been controlling the basilisk.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What're we going to do?'' 
said ###CHAR68###, whose eyes were flashing. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Should we go straight to ###CHAR96###?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Let's go to the staff room,'' said ###CHAR68###, jumping up. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``She'll be there in ten minutes. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It's nearly break.'' 
They ran downstairs. 
Not wanting to be discovered hanging around in another corridor, they went straight into the deserted staff room. 
It was a large, paneled room full of dark, wooden chairs. 
###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### paced around it, too excited to sit down. 
But the bell to signal break never came. 
Instead, echoing through the corridors came Professor ###CHAR96###'s voice, magically magnified. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``All students to return to their House dormitories at once. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###All teach ers return to the staff room. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Immediately, please. '' 
###CHAR68### wheeled around to stare at ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Not another attack? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Not now?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What'll we do?'' 
said ###CHAR68###, aghast. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Go back to the dormitory?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``No,'' said ###CHAR68###, glancing around. 
There was an ugly sort of wardrobe to ###CHAR68###'s left, full of the teachers' cloaks. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``In here. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Let's hear what it's all about. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Then we can tell them what we've found out.'' 
They hid themselves inside it, listening to the rumbling of hundreds of people moving overhead, and the staff room door banging open. 
From between the musty folds of the cloaks, they watched the teachers filtering into the room. 
Some of them were looking puzzled, others downright scared. 
Then Professor ###CHAR96### arrived. 
###DIALOGUE###``It has happened,'' she told the silent staff room. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``A student has been taken by the monster. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Right into the Chamber itself.'' 
Professor ###CHAR2### let out a squeal. 
Professor Sprout clapped her hands over her mouth. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR63### gripped the back of a chair very hard and said, ``How can you be sure?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``The Heir of Slytherin,'' said Professor McGonagall, who was very white, ``left another message. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Right underneath the first one. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###`Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever. ''' 
Professor ###CHAR2### burst into tears. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Who is it?'' 
said ###CHAR85### , who had sunk, weak-kneed, into a chair. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Which student?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``###CHAR76### ,'' said Professor ###CHAR96###. 
###CHAR68### felt ###CHAR68### slide silently down onto the wardrobe floor beside ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``We shall have to send all the students home tomorrow,'' said Professor ###CHAR96###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``This is the end of Hogwarts. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR94### always said...'' The staffroom door banged open again. 
For one wild moment, ###CHAR68### was sure it would be ###CHAR94###. 
But it was ###CHAR73###, and ###CHAR68### was beaming. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``So sorry - dozed off - what have I missed?'' 
###CHAR68### didn't seem to notice that the other teachers were looking at ###CHAR68### with something remarkably like hatred. 
###CHAR63### stepped forward. 
###DIALOGUE###``Just the man,'' ###CHAR63### said. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``The very man. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###A girl has been snatched by the monster, ###CHAR73###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Taken into the Chamber of Secrets itself. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Your moment has come at last.'' 
###CHAR73### blanched. 
###DIALOGUE###``That's right, ###CHAR73###,'' chipped in Professor Sprout. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Weren't you saying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``I - well, I -``sputtered ###CHAR73###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Yes, didn't you tell me you were sure you knew what was inside it?'' 
piped up Professor ###CHAR2###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``D-did I? 
###DIALOGUE###I don't recall -'' ``I certainly remember you saying you were sorry you hadn't had a crack at the monster before ###CHAR22### was arrested,'' said ###CHAR63###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Didn't you say that the whole affair had been bungled, and that you should have been given a free rein from the first?'' 
###CHAR73### stared around at ###CHAR73###'s stony-faced colleagues. 
###DIALOGUE###``I - I really never - you may have misunderstood -'' ``We'll leave it to you, then, ###CHAR73###,'' said Professor ###CHAR96###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Tonight will be an excellent time to do it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###We'll make sure everyone's out of your way. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###You'll be able to tackle the monster all by youself. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###A free rein at last.'' 
###CHAR73### gazed desperately around ###CHAR73###, but nobody came to the rescue. 
###CHAR73### didn't look remotely handsome anymore. 
###CHAR73###'s lip was trembling, and in the absence of ###CHAR73###'s usually toothy grin, ###CHAR73### looked weak-chinned and feeble. 
###DIALOGUE###``V - very well,'' ###CHAR73### said. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I'll - I'll be in my office, getting getting ready.'' 
And ###CHAR73### left the room. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Right,'' said Professor ###CHAR96###, whose nostrils were flared, ``that's got ###CHAR73### out from under our feet. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The Heads of Houses should go and inform their students what has happened. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Tell them the ###CHAR62### will take them home first thing tomorrow. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Will the rest of you please make sure no students have been left outside their dormitories.'' 
The teachers rose and left, one by one. 
It was probably the worst day of ###CHAR68###'s entire life. 
###CHAR68###, ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR55###, and ###CHAR19### sat together in a corner of the Gryffindor common room, unable to say anything to each other. 
###CHAR70### wasn't there. 
###CHAR70### had gone to send an owl to Mr. and ###CHAR83### , then shut himself up in ###CHAR70###'s dormitory. 
No afternoon ever lasted as long as that one, nor had Gryffindor Tower ever been so crowded, yet so quiet. 
Near sunset, ###CHAR55### and ###CHAR19### went up to bed, unable to sit there any longer. 
###DIALOGUE###``She knew something, ###CHAR68###,'' said ###CHAR68###, speaking for the first time since they had entered the wardrobe in the staff room. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``That's why she was taken. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It wasn't some stupid thing about ###CHAR70### at all., She'd found out something about the Chamber of Secrets. 
###DIALOGUE###That must be why she was -'' ###CHAR68### rubbed ###CHAR68###'s eyes frantically. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I mean, she was a pureblood. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There can't be any other reason.'' 
###CHAR68### could see the sun sinking, blood-red, below the skyline. 
This was the worst ###CHAR68### had ever felt. 
If only there was something they could do. 
Anything. 
###DIALOGUE###``Harry'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``D'you think there's any chance at all she's not - you know -'' ###CHAR68### didn't know what to say. 
###CHAR68### couldn't see how ###CHAR76### could still be alive. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``D'you know what?'' 
said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I think we should go and see ###CHAR73###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Tell ###CHAR73### what we know. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR73###'s going to try and get into the Chamber. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###We can tell ###CHAR73### where we think it is, and tell ###CHAR73### it's a basilisk in there.'' 
Because Harry couldn't think of anything else to do, and because he wanted to be doing something, he agreed. 
The Gryffindors around them were so miserable, and felt so sorry for the Weasleys, that nobody tried to stop them as they got up, crossed the room, and left through the portrait hole. 
Darkness was falling as they walked down to ###CHAR73###'s office. 
There seemed to be a lot of activity going on inside it. 
They could hear scraping, thumps, and hurried footsteps. 
###CHAR68### knocked and there was a sudden silence from inside. 
Then the door opened the tiniest crack and they saw one of ###CHAR73###'s eyes peering through it. 
###DIALOGUE###``Oh - ###CHAR95### - ###CHAR84### -'' ###CHAR73### said, opening the door a bit wider. 
###DIALOGUE###``I'm rather busy at the moment - if you would be quick -'' ``Professor, we've got some information for you,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We think it'll help you.'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Er - well - it's not terribly -'' The side of ###CHAR73###'s face that they could see looked very uncomfortable. 
###DIALOGUE###``I mean - well all right -'' ###CHAR68### opened the door and they entered. 
###CHAR68###'s office had been almost completely stripped. 
Two large trunks stood open on the floor. 
Robes, jade-green, lilac, midnightblue, had been hastily folded into one of them; books were jumbled untidily into the other. 
The photographs that had covered the walls were now crammed into boxes on the desk. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Are you going somewhere?'' 
said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``Er, well, yes,'' said ###CHAR73###, ripping a life-size poster of himself from the back of the door as ###CHAR73### spoke and starting to roll it up. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Urgent call - unavoidable - got to go -'' ``What about my sister?'' 
said ###CHAR68### jerkily. 
###DIALOGUE###``Well, as to that - most unfortunate -'' said ###CHAR73###, avoiding their eyes as ###CHAR73### wrenched open a drawer and started emptying the contents into a bag. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``No one regrets more than I -'' ``You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher!'' 
said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You can't go now! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Not with all the Dark stuff going on here!'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Well - I must say - when I took the job -'' ###CHAR73### muttered, now piling socks on top of ###CHAR73###'s robes. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``nothing in the job description - didn't expect -'' ``You mean you're running away?'' 
said ###CHAR68### disbelievingly. 
###DIALOGUE###``After all that stuff you did in your books -'' ``Books can be misleading,'' said ###CHAR73### delicately. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You wrote them!'' 
###CHAR68### shouted. 
###DIALOGUE###``My dear boy,'' said ###CHAR73###, straightening up and frowning at ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Do use your common sense. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###My books wouldn't have sold half as well if people didn't think Id done all those things. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###No one wants to read about some ugly old Armenian warlock, even if he did save a village from werewolves. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###He'd look dreadful on the front cover. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###No dress sense at all. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###And the witch who banished the Bandon Banshee had a harelip. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I mean, come on -'' ``So you've just been taking credit for what a load of other people have done?'' 
said ###CHAR68### incredulously. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Harry, ###CHAR68###,'' said ###CHAR73###, shaking ###CHAR73###'s head impatiently, ``it's not nearly as simple as that. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There was work involved. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I had to track these people down. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Ask them exactly how they managed to do what they did. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Then I had to put a Memory Charm on them so they wouldn't remember doing it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###If there's one thing I pride myself on, it's my Memory Charms. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###No, it's been a lot of work, ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It's not all book signings and publicity photos, you know. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###You want fame, you have to be prepared for a long hard slog.'' 
###CHAR73### banged the lids of ###CHAR73###'s trunks shut and locked them. 
###DIALOGUE###``Let's see,'' ###CHAR73### said. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I think that's everything. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Yes. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Only one thing left.'' 
###CHAR73### pulled out ###CHAR73###'s wand and turned to them. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Awfully sorry, boys, but I'll have to put a Memory Charm on you now. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Can't have you blabbing my secrets all over the place. 
###DIALOGUE###Id never sell another book -'' ###CHAR68### reached ###CHAR68###'s wand just in time. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR73### had barely raised ###CHAR73###'s , when ###CHAR68### bellowed, ``Expelliarmus!'' 
###CHAR73### was blasted backward, falling over ###CHAR73###'s trunk; ###CHAR73###'s wand flew high into the air; ###CHAR68### caught it, and flung it out of the open window. 
###DIALOGUE###``Shouldn't have let Professor ###CHAR63### teach us that one,'' said ###CHAR68### furiously, kicking ###CHAR73###'s trunk aside. 
###CHAR73### was looking up at ###CHAR73###, feeble once more. 
###CHAR68### was still pointing ###CHAR68###'s wand at ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What d'you want me to do?'' 
said ###CHAR73### weakly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I don't know where the Chamber of Secrets is. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There's nothing I can do.'' 
###DIALOGUE###``You're in luck,'' said ###CHAR68###, forcing ###CHAR73### to ###CHAR68###'s feet at wandpoint. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We think we know where it is. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###And what's inside it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Let's go.'' 
They marched ###CHAR73### out of ###CHAR73###'s office and down the nearest stairs, along the dark corridor where the messages shone on the wall, to the door of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. 
They sent ###CHAR73### in first. 
###CHAR68### was pleased to see that ###CHAR68### was shaking. 
Moaning ###CHAR20### was sitting on the tank of the end toilet. 
###DIALOGUE###``Oh, it's you,'' ###CHAR20### said when ###CHAR20### saw ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What do you want this time?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``To ask you how you died,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
Myrtle's whole aspect changed at once. 
She looked as though she had never been asked such a flattering question. 
###DIALOGUE###``Ooooh, it was dreadful,'' she said with relish. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It happened right in here. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I died in this very stall. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I remember it so well. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Id hidden because ###CHAR41### was teasing me about my glasses. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The door was locked, and I was crying, and then I heard somebody come in. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They said something funny. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###A different language, I think it must have been. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Anyway, what really got me was that it was a boy speaking. 
###DIALOGUE###So I unlocked the door, to tell him to go and use his own toilet, and then -'' ###CHAR20### swelled importantly, ###CHAR20###'s face shining. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I died.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``How?'' 
said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``No idea,'' said Myrtle in hushed tones. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I just remember seeing a pair of great, big, yellow eyes. 
###DIALOGUE###My whole body sort of seized up, and then I was floating away ...'' She looked dreamily at Harry. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``And then I came back again. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I was determined to haunt ###CHAR41### , you see. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Oh, she was sorry she'd ever laughed at my glasses.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Where exactly did you see the eyes?'' 
said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``Somewhere there,'' said Myrtle, pointing vaguely toward the sink in front of her toilet. 
###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### hurried over to it. 
###CHAR73### was standing well back, a look of utter terror on ###CHAR73###'s face. 
It looked like an ordinary sink. 
They examined every inch of it, inside and out, including the pipes below. 
And then ###CHAR68### saw it: Scratched on the side of one of the copper taps was a tiny snake. 
###DIALOGUE###``That tap's never worked,'' said Myrtle brightly as ###CHAR68### tried to turn it. 
###DIALOGUE###``Harry,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Say something. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Something in Parseltongue.'' 
###DIALOGUE###``But -'' ###CHAR68### thought hard. 
The only times ###CHAR68###'d ever managed to speak Parseltongue were when ###CHAR68###'d been faced with a real snake. 
###CHAR68### stared hard at the tiny- engraving, trying to imagine it was real. 
###DIALOGUE###``Open up,'' ###CHAR68### said. 
###CHAR68### looked at ###CHAR68###, who shook ###CHAR68###'s head. 
###DIALOGUE###``English,'' ###CHAR68### said. 
###CHAR68### looked back at the snake, willing himself to believe it was alive. 
If ###CHAR68### moved ###CHAR68###'s head, the candlelight made it look as though it were moving. 
###DIALOGUE###``Open up,'' ###CHAR68### said. 
Except that the words weren't what ###CHAR68### heard; a strange hissing had escaped ###CHAR68###, and at once the tap glowed with a brilliant white light and began to spin. 
Next second, the sink began to move; the sink, in fact, sank, right out of sight, leaving a large pipe exposed, a pipe wide enough for a man to slide into. 
###CHAR68### heard ###CHAR68### gasp and looked up again. 
###CHAR68### had made up ###CHAR68###'s mind what ###CHAR68### was going to do. 
###DIALOGUE###``I'm going down there,'' ###CHAR68### said. 
. 
###CHAR68### couldn't not go, not now they had found the entrance to the Chamber, not if there was even the faintest, slimmest, wildest chance that ###CHAR76### might be alive. 
###DIALOGUE###``Me too,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
There was a pause. 
###DIALOGUE###``Well, you hardly seem to need me,'' said ###CHAR73###, with a shadow of ###CHAR73###'s old smile. 
###DIALOGUE###``I'll just -'' ###CHAR73### put ###CHAR73###'s hand on the door knob, but ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### both pointed their wands at ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``You can go first,'' ###CHAR68### snarled. 
White-faced and wandless, ###CHAR73### approached the opening. 
###DIALOGUE###``Boys,'' ###CHAR73### said, ###CHAR73###'s voice feeble. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Boys, what good will it do?'' 
###CHAR68### jabbed ###CHAR68### in the back with ###CHAR68###'s wand. 
###CHAR73### slid ###CHAR73###'s legs into the pipe. 
###DIALOGUE###``I really don't think -'' ###CHAR73### started to say, but ###CHAR68### gave ###CHAR68### a push, and ###CHAR68### slid out of sight. 
###CHAR68### followed quickly. 
###CHAR68### lowered himself slowly into the pipe, then let go. 
It was like rushing down an endless, slimy, dark slide. 
###CHAR68### could see more pipes branching off in all directions, but none as large as theirs, which twisted and turned, sloping steeply downward, and ###CHAR68### knew that ###CHAR68### was falling deeper below the school than even the dungeons. 
Behind ###CHAR68### could hear ###CHAR68###, thudding slightly at the curves. 
And then, just as ###CHAR68### had begun to worry about what would happen when ###CHAR68### hit the ground, the pipe leveled out, and ###CHAR68### shot out of the end with a wet thud, landing on the damp floor of a dark stone tunnel large enough to stand in. 
###CHAR73### was getting to ###CHAR73###'s feet a little ways away, covered in slime and white as a ghost. 
###CHAR68### stood aside as ###CHAR68### came whizzing out of the pipe, too. 
###DIALOGUE###``We must be miles under the school,'' said ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR68###'s voice echoing in the black tunnel. 
###DIALOGUE###``Under the lake, probably,'' said ###CHAR68###, squinting around at the dark, slimy walls. 
All three of them turned to stare into the darkness ahead. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Lumos!'' 
###CHAR68### muttered to ###CHAR68###'s wand and it lit again. 
###DIALOGUE###``C'mon,'' ###CHAR68### said to ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR73###, and off they went, their footsteps slapping loudly on the wet floor. 
The tunnel was so dark that they could only see a little distance ahead. 
Their shadows on the wet walls looked monstrous in the wandlight. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Remember,'' ###CHAR68### said quietly as they walked cautiously forward, ``any sign of movement, close your eyes right away . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###... But the tunnel was quiet as the grave, and the first unexpected sound they heard was a loud crunch as ###CHAR68### stepped on what turned out to be a rat's skull. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### lowered ###CHAR68###'s wand to look at the floor and saw that it was littered with small animal bones. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Trying very hard not to imagine what ###CHAR76### might look like if they found ###CHAR76###, ###CHAR68### led the way forward, around a dark bend in the tunnel. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Harry - there's something up there -'' said ###CHAR68### hoarsely, grabbing ###CHAR68###'s shoulder. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They froze, watching. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### could just see the outline of something huge and curved, lying right across the tunnel. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It wasn't moving. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Maybe it's asleep,'' ###CHAR68### breathed, glancing back at the other two. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR73###'s hands were pressed over ###CHAR73###'s eyes. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### turned back to look at the thing, ###CHAR68###'s heart beating so fast it hurt. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Very slowly, ###CHAR68###'s eyes as narrow as ###CHAR68### could make them and still see, ###CHAR68### edged forward, ###CHAR68###'s wand held high. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The light slid over a gigantic snake skin, of a vivid, poisonous green, lying curled and empty across the tunnel floor. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The creature that had shed it must have been twenty feet long at least. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Blimey,'' said ###CHAR68### weakly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There was a sudden movement behind them. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR73### 's knees had given way. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Get up,'' said ###CHAR68### sharply, pointing ###CHAR68###'s wand at ###CHAR73###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR73### got to ###CHAR73###'s feet - then ###CHAR73### dived at ###CHAR68###, knocking ###CHAR68### to the ground. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### jumped forward, but too late - ###CHAR73### was straightening up, panting, ###CHAR68###'s wand in ###CHAR68###'s hand and a gleaming smile back on ###CHAR68###'s face. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``The adventure ends here, boys!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### said. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I shall take a bit of this skin back up to the school, tell them I was too late to save the girl, and that you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body - say good-bye to your memories!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### raised ###CHAR68###'s Spellotaped wand high over ###CHAR68###'s head and yelled, ``Obliviate!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The wand exploded with the force of a small bomb. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### flung ###CHAR68###'s arms over ###CHAR68###'s head and ran, slipping over the coils of snake skin, out of the way of great chunks of tunnel ceiling that were thundering to the floor. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Next moment, ###CHAR68### was standing alone, gazing at a solid wall of broken rock. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR68###!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### shouted. 
###DIALOGUE###``Are you okay? 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR68###!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I'm here!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###came ###CHAR68###'s muffled voice from behind the rockfall. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I'm okay - this git's not, though - ###CHAR68### got blasted by the wand =' There was a dull thud and a loud ``ow!'' 
It sounded as though ###CHAR68### had just kicked ###CHAR73### in the shins. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What now?'' 
###CHAR68###'s voice said, sounding desperate. 
###DIALOGUE###``We can't get through - it'll take ages ...'' ###CHAR68### looked up at the tunnel ceiling. 
Huge cracks had appeared in it. 
###CHAR68### had never tried to break apart anything as large as these rocks by magic, and now didn't seem a good moment to try - what if the whole tunnel caved in? 
###DIALOGUE###There was another thud and another ``ow!'' 
from behind the rocks. 
They were wasting time. 
###CHAR76### had already been in the Chamber of Secrets for hours ... ###CHAR68### knew there was only one thing to do. 
###DIALOGUE###``Wait there,'' ###CHAR68### called to ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Wait with ###CHAR73###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I'll go on... If I'm not back in an hour... There was a very pregnant pause, ``I'll try and shift some of this rock,'' said ###CHAR68###, who seemed to be trying to keep ###CHAR68###'s voice steady. 
###DIALOGUE###``So you can - can get back through. 
###DIALOGUE###And, ###CHAR68### -'' ``See you in a bit,'' said ###CHAR68###, trying to inject some confidence into ###CHAR68###'s shaking voice. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###And ###CHAR68### set off alone past the giant snake skin. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Soon the distant noise of ###CHAR68### straining to shift the rocks was gone. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The tunnel turned and turned again. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Every nerve in ###CHAR68###'s body was tingling unpleasantly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### wanted the tunnel to end, yet dreaded what ###CHAR68###'d find when it did. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###And then, at last, as ###CHAR68### crept around yet another bend, ###CHAR68### saw a solid wall ahead on which two entwined serpents were carved, their eyes set with great, glinting emeralds. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### approached, ###CHAR68###'s throat very dry. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There was no need to pretend these stone snakes were real; their eyes looked strangely alive. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### could guess what ###CHAR68### had to do. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### cleared ###CHAR68###'s throat, and the emerald eyes seemed to flicker. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Open, ``said ###CHAR68###, in a low, faint hiss. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The serpents parted as the wall cracked open, the halves slid smoothly out of sight, and ###CHAR68###, shaking from head to foot, walked inside. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###e was standing at the end of a very long, dimly lit chamber. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Towering stone pillars entwined with more carved serpents rose to support a ceiling lost in darkness, casting long, black shadows through the odd, greenish gloom that filled the place. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###'s heart beating very fast, ###CHAR68### stood listening to the chill silence. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Could the basilisk be lurking in a shadowy corner, behind a pillar? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###And where was ###CHAR76###? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### pulled out ###CHAR68###'s wand and moved forward between the serpentine columns. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Every careful footstep echoed loudly off the shadowy walls. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### kept ###CHAR68###'s eyes narrowed, ready to clamp them shut at the smallest sign of movement. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The hollow eye sockets of the stone snakes seemed to be following ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###More than once, with a jolt of the stomach, ###CHAR68### thought ###CHAR68### saw one stir. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Then, as ###CHAR68### drew level with the last pair of pillars, a statue high as the Chamber itself loomed into view, standing against the back wall. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### had to crane ###CHAR68###'s neck to look up into the giant face above: It was ancient and monkeyish, with a long, thin beard that fell almost to the bottom of the wizard's sweeping stone robes, where two enormous gray feet stood on the smooth Chamber floor. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###And between the feet, facedown, lay a small, black-robed figure with flaming-red hair. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR76###!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### muttered, sprinting to her and dropping to ###CHAR68###'s knees. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR76### - don't be dead - please don't be dead -'' ###CHAR68### flung ###CHAR68###'s wand aside, grabbed ###CHAR76###'s shoulders, and turned ###CHAR76###'s over. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR76###'s face was white as marble, and as cold, yet ###CHAR76###'s eyes were closed, so ###CHAR76### wasn't Petrified. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###But then ###CHAR76### must be ``###CHAR76###, please wake up,'' ###CHAR68### muttered desperately, shaking ###CHAR76###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR76###'s head lolled hopelessly from side to side. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR76### won't wake,'' said a soft voice. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Harry jumped and spun around on his knees. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###A tall, black-haired boy was leaning against the nearest pillar, watching. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###He was strangely blurred around the edges, as though ###CHAR68### were looking at ###CHAR68### through a misted window. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###But there was no mistaking ###CHAR68### ``###CHAR11### - ###CHAR11### ?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR27### nodded, not taking ###CHAR27###'s eyes off ###CHAR68###'s face. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What d'you mean, ###CHAR76### won't wake?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### said desperately. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR76###'s not - ###CHAR76###'s not -?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR76###'s still alive,'' said ###CHAR27###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But only just.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### stared at ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR11### had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago, yet here ###CHAR68### stood, a weird, misty light shining about ###CHAR68###, not a day older than sixteen. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Are you a ghost?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### said uncertainly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``A memory,'' said ###CHAR27### quietly. 
###DIALOGUE###``Preserved in a diary for fifty years. 
###CHAR11### pointed toward the floor near the statue's giant toes. 
Lying open there was the little black diary ###CHAR68### had found in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. 
For a second, ###CHAR68### wondered how it had got there - but there were more pressing matters to deal with. 
###DIALOGUE###``You've got to help me, ###CHAR11###,'' ###CHAR68### said, raising ###CHAR76###'s head again. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We've got to get her out of here. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There's a basilisk ... I don't know where it is, but it could be along any moment ... Please, help me -1-RRB- ###CHAR27### didn't move. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###, sweating, managed to hoist ###CHAR76### half off the floor, and bent to pick up ###CHAR68###'s wand again. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###But ###CHAR68###'s wand had gone. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Did you see -?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### looked up. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR27### was still watching ###CHAR27### - twirling ###CHAR68###'s wand between ###CHAR68###'s long fingers. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Thanks,'' said ###CHAR68###, stretching out ###CHAR68###'s hand for it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###A smile curled the corners of ###CHAR27###'s mouth. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### continued to stare at ###CHAR68###, twirling the wand idly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Listen,'' said ###CHAR68### urgently, ###CHAR68###'s knees sagging with ###CHAR76###'s dead weight. 
###DIALOGUE###``We've got to go! 
###DIALOGUE###If the basilisk comes -'' ``It won't come until it is called,'' said ###CHAR27### calmly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### lowered ###CHAR76### back onto the floor, unable to hold ###CHAR76###'s up any longer. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What d'you mean?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### said. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Look, give me my wand, I might need it -'' ###CHAR27###'s smile broadened. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You won't be needing it,'' ###CHAR27### said. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### stared at ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What d'you mean, I won't be -?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I've waited a long time for this, ###CHAR54### ,'' said ###CHAR27###. 
###DIALOGUE###``For the chance to see you. 
###DIALOGUE###To speak to you.'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Look,'' said ###CHAR68###, losing patience, ``I don't think you get it. 
We're in the Chamber of Secrets. 
###DIALOGUE###We can talk later -'' ``We're going to talk now,'' said ###CHAR27###, still smiling broadly, and ###CHAR68### pocketed ###CHAR68###'s wand. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### stared at ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There was something very funny going on here ... ``How did ###CHAR76### get like this?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### asked slowly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Well, that's an interesting question,'' said ###CHAR27### pleasantly. 
###DIALOGUE###``And quite a long story. 
###DIALOGUE###I suppose the real reason ###CHAR76### 's like this is because ###CHAR76### opened ###CHAR76###'s heart and spilled all ###CHAR76###'s secrets to an invisible stranger.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What are you talking about?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``The diary,'' said ###CHAR27###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###`My diary. 
###DIALOGUE###Little ###CHAR76###'s been writing in it for months and months, telling me all ###CHAR76###'s pitiful worries and woes - how ###CHAR76###'s brothers tease ###CHAR76###, how ###CHAR76### had to come to school with secondhand robes and books, how'' -###CHAR27###'s eyes glinted ``how ###CHAR76### didn't think famous, good, great ###CHAR54### would ever like ###CHAR76###'s ...'' All the time ###CHAR27### spoke, ###CHAR27###'s eyes never left ###CHAR68###'s face. 
There was an almost hungry look in them. 
###DIALOGUE###``It's very boring, having to listen to the silly little troubles of an elevenyear- old girl,'' ###CHAR68### went on. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But I was patient. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I wrote back. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I was sympathetic, I was kind. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR76### simply loved me. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###No one's ever understood me like you, ###CHAR11### ... I'm so glad I've got this diary to confide in ... It's like having a friend I can carry around in my pocket ... Riddle laughed, a high, cold laugh that didn't suit him. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It made the hairs stand up on the back of ###CHAR68###'s neck. 
###DIALOGUE###``If I say it myself, ###CHAR68###, I've always been able to charm the people I needed. 
So ###CHAR76### poured out ###CHAR76###'s soul to me, and ###CHAR76###'s soul happened to be exactly what I wanted ... I grew stronger and stronger on a diet of ###CHAR76###'s deepest fears, ###CHAR76###'s darkest secrets. 
I grew powerful, far more powerful than little ###CHAR23### . 
###DIALOGUE###Powerful enough to start feeding ###CHAR23### a few of my secrets, to start pouring a little of my soul back into ###CHAR23###'s ...'' ``What d'you mean?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68###, whose mouth had gone very dry. '' 
###DIALOGUE###Haven't you guessed yet, ###CHAR54### ?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR27### softly. 
###DIALOGUE###``###CHAR76### opened the Chamber of Secrets. 
###CHAR76### strangled the school roosters and daubed threatening messages on the walls. 
###CHAR76### set the Serpent of Slytherin on four ###CHAR14###, and the Squib's cat. 
###DIALOGUE###``No,'' ###CHAR68### whispered. 
###DIALOGUE###``Yes,'' said ###CHAR27###, calmly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Of course, ###CHAR76### didn't know what ###CHAR76### was doing at first. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It was very amusing. 
###DIALOGUE###I wish you could have seen ###CHAR76###'s new diary entries ... far more interesting, they became ... Dear ###CHAR11###,'' ###CHAR27### recited, watching ###CHAR68###'s horrified face, `I think I'm losing my memory. 
There are rooster feathers all over my robes and 1 don't know how they got there. 
Dear ###CHAR11###, l can't remember what 1 did on the night of Halloween, but a cat was attacked and I've got paint all down my front. 
Dear Tom, ###CHAR70### keeps telling me I'm pale and I'm not myself. 
I think he suspects me... There was another attack today and I don't know where I was. 
###CHAR11###, what am I going to do? 
###DIALOGUE###I think I'm going mad... I think I'm the one attacking everyone, ###CHAR11###!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###'s fists were clenched, the nails digging deep into ###CHAR68###'s Palms. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``it took a very long time for stupid little ###CHAR76### to stop trusting ###CHAR76###'s diary,'' said ###CHAR27###. 
###DIALOGUE###``But ###CHAR76### finally became suspicious and tried to dispose of it. 
And that's where you came in, ###CHAR68###. 
You found it, and I couldn't have been more delighted. 
###DIALOGUE###Of all the people who could have picked it up, it was you, the very person I was most anxious to meet ...'' ``And why did you want to meet me?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Anger was coursing through ###CHAR68###, and it was an effort to keep ###CHAR68###'s voice steady. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Well, you see, ###CHAR76### told me all about you, ###CHAR68###,'' said ###CHAR27###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Your whole fascinating history. '' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR27###'s eyes roved over the lightning scar on ###CHAR68###'s forehead, and their expression grew hungrier. 
###DIALOGUE###``I knew I must find out more about you, talk to you, meet you if I could. 
###DIALOGUE###So I decided to show you my famous capture of that great oaf, ###CHAR22###, to gain your trust -'' ``###CHAR22###'s my friend,'' said ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR68###'s voice now shaking. 
###DIALOGUE###``And you framed him, didn't you? 
###DIALOGUE###I thought you made a mistake, but -'' ###CHAR27### laughed ###CHAR27###'s high laugh again. 
###DIALOGUE###``It was my word against ###CHAR22###'s, ###CHAR68###. 
Well, you can imagine how it looked to old Armando Dippet. 
On the one hand, ###CHAR11### , poor but brilliant, parentless but so brave, school prefect, model student ... on the other hand, big, blundering ###CHAR22###, in trouble every other week, trying to raise werewolf cubs under ###CHAR11###'s bed, sneaking off to the Forbidden Forest to wrestle trolls ... but I admit, even I was surprised how well the plan worked. 
I thought someone must realize that ###CHAR22### couldn't possibly be the Heir of Slytherin. 
It had taken me five whole years to find out everything I could about the Chamber of Secrets and discover the secret entrance ... as though ###CHAR22### had the brains, or the power! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Only the Transfiguration teacher, ###CHAR94###, seemed to think ###CHAR22### was innocent. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR94### persuaded Dipper to keep ###CHAR22### and train ###CHAR94### as gamekeeper. 
###DIALOGUE###Yes, I think ###CHAR94### might have guessed ... ###CHAR94### never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did ...'' ``I bet ###CHAR94### saw right through you,'' said ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR68###'s teeth gritted. 
###DIALOGUE###``Well, ###CHAR94### certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after ###CHAR22### was expelled,'' said ###CHAR27### carelessly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###But I wasn't going to waste those long years Id spent searching for it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I decided to leave behind a diary, preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that one day, with luck, I would be able to lead another in my footsteps, and finish ###CHAR45### 's noble work.'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Well, you haven't finished it,'' said ###CHAR68### triumphantly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``No one's died this time, not even the cat. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###In a few hours the Mandrake Draught will be ready and everyone who was Petrified will be all right again -'' ``Haven't I already told you,'' said ###CHAR27### quietly, ``that killing ###CHAR14### doesn't matter to me anymore? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###For many months now, my new target has been -you.'' 
###CHAR68### stared at ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Imagine how angry I was when the next time my diary was opened, it was ###CHAR76### who was writing to me, not you. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR76### saw you with the diary, you see, and panicked. 
###DIALOGUE###``What if you found out how to work it, and I repeated all ###CHAR76###'s secrets to you? 
What if, even worse, I told you who'd been strangling roosters? 
So the foolish little brat waited until your dormitory was deserted and stole it back. 
But I knew what I must do. 
It was clear to me that you were on the trail of ###CHAR45###'s heir. 
From everything ###CHAR76### had told me about you, I knew you would go to any lengths to solve the mystery -- particularly if one of your best friends was attacked. 
###DIALOGUE###And ###CHAR76### had told me the whole school was buzzing because you could speak Parseltongue ... ``So I made ###CHAR76### write ###CHAR76###'s own farewell on the wall and come down here to wait. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR76### struggled and cried and became very boring. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###But there isn't much life left in ###CHAR76###'s ... ###CHAR76### put too much into the diary, into me. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Enough to let me leave its pages at last ... I have been waiting for you to appear since we arrived here. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I knew you'd come. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I have many questions for you, ###CHAR54### .'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Like what?'' 
Harry spat, fists still clenched. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Well,'' said ###CHAR27###, smiling pleasantly, ``how is it that you a skinny boy with no extraordinary magical talent - managed to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while ###CHAR21### 's powers were destroyed?'' 
There was an odd red gleam in ###CHAR27###'s hungry eyes now. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Why do you care how I escaped?'' 
said ###CHAR68### slowly. 
###DIALOGUE###``###CHAR21### was after your time ...'' ``###CHAR21###,'' said ###CHAR27### softly, ``is my past, present, and future, ###CHAR54### ...'' ###CHAR27### pulled ###CHAR68###'s wand from ###CHAR68###'s pocket and began to trace it through the air, writing three shimmering words:
TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE
Then ###CHAR68### waved the wand once, and the letters of ###CHAR68###'s name rearranged themselves:
I AM 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR21### ``You see?'' 
###CHAR21### whispered. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts, to my most intimate friends only, of course. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###You think I was going to use my filthy Muggle father's name forever? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I, in whose veins runs the blood of ###CHAR45### himself, through my mother's side? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I, keep the name of a foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just because ###CHAR45### found out ###CHAR45###'s wife was a witch? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###No, ###CHAR68### - I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!'' 
###CHAR68###'s brain seemed to have jammed. 
###CHAR68### stared numbly at Riddle, at the orphaned boy who had grown up to murder ###CHAR68###'s own parents, and so many others ... At last ###CHAR68### forced himself to -,peak. 
###DIALOGUE###``You're not,'' ###CHAR68### said, ###CHAR68###'s quiet voice full of hatred. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Not what?'' 
snapped ###CHAR27###. 
###DIALOGUE###``Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,'' said ###CHAR68###, breathing fast. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Sorry to disappoint you and all that, but the greatest wizard in the world is ###CHAR94### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Everyone says so. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Even when you were strong, you didn't dare try and take over at Hogwarts. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR94### saw through you when you were at school and ###CHAR94### still frightens you now, wherever you're hiding these days -'' The smile had gone from Riddle's face, to be replaced by a very ugly look. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR94###'s been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me!'' 
###CHAR68### hissed. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR94###'s not as gone as you might think!'' 
###CHAR68### retorted. 
###CHAR68### was speaking at random, wanting to scare Riddle, wishing rather than believing it to be true ###CHAR27### opened ###CHAR27###'s mouth, but froze. 
Music was coming from somewhere. 
###CHAR27### whirled around to stare down the empty Chamber. 
The music was growing louder. 
It was eerie, spine-tingling, unearthly; it lifted the hair on ###CHAR68###'s scalp and made ###CHAR68###'s heart feel as though it was swelling to twice its normal size. 
Then, as the music reached such a pitch that ###CHAR68### felt it vibrating inside ###CHAR68###'s own ribs, flames erupted at the top of the nearest pillar. 
A crimson bird the size of a swan had appeared, piping its weird music to the vaulted ceiling. 
It had a glittering golden tail as long as a peacock's and gleaming golden talons, which were gripping a ragged bundle. 
A second later, the bird was flying straight at Harry. 
It dropped the ragged thing it was carrying at his feet, then landed heavily on his shoulder. 
As it folded its great wings, ###CHAR68### looked up and saw it had a long, sharp golden beak and a beady black eye. 
The bird stopped singing. 
It sat still and warm next to ###CHAR68###'s cheek, gazing steadily at Riddle. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``That's a phoenix said ###CHAR27###, staring shrewdly back at it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Fawkes?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### breathed, and ###CHAR68### felt the bird's golden claws squeeze ###CHAR68###'s shoulder gently ``And that -'' said ###CHAR27###, now eyeing the ragged thing that ###CHAR8### had dropped, ``that's the old school Sorting Hat -'' So it was. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Patched, frayed, and dirty, the hat lay motionless at ###CHAR68###'s feet. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR27### began to laugh again. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR27### laughed so hard that the dark chamber rang with it, as though ten Riddles were laughing at once ``This is what ###CHAR94### sends ###CHAR94###'s defender! 
A songbird and an old hat! 
Do you feel brave, ###CHAR54### ? 
###DIALOGUE###Do you feel safe now?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### didn't answer. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### might not see what use Fawkes or the Sorting Hat were, but ###CHAR68### was no longer alone, and ###CHAR68### waited for Riddle to stop laughing with his courage mounting. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``To business, ###CHAR68###,'' said ###CHAR27###, still smiling broadly. 
###DIALOGUE###``Twice - in your past, in my future - we have met. 
And twice I failed to kill you. 
How did you survive? 
Tell me everything. 
###DIALOGUE###The longer you talk,'' ###CHAR27### added softly, ``the longer you stay alive.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### was thinking fast, weighing ###CHAR68###'s chances. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR27### had the wand. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR27###, ###CHAR68###, had Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, neither of which would be much good in a duel. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It looked bad, all right ... but the longer ###CHAR27### stood there, the more life was dwindling out of ###CHAR76### ... and in the meantime, ###CHAR68### noticed suddenly, ###CHAR27###'s outline was becoming clearer, more solid ... If it had to be a fight between ###CHAR68### and Riddle, better sooner than later. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``No one knows why you lost your powers when you attacked me,'' said ###CHAR68### abruptly. 
###DIALOGUE###``I don't know myself But I know why you couldn't kill me. 
Because my mother died to save me. 
###DIALOGUE###My common Muggle-born mother,'' ###CHAR68### added, shaking with suppressed rage. 
###DIALOGUE###``She stopped you killing me. 
And I've seen the real you, I saw you last year. 
You're a wreck. 
You're barely alive. 
That's where all your power got you. 
You're in hiding. 
###DIALOGUE###You're ugly, you're foul -'' ###CHAR27###'s face contorted. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Then ###CHAR27### forced it into an awful smile. 
###DIALOGUE###``So. 
Your mother died to save you. 
Yes, that's a powerful countercharm. 
I can see now ... there is nothing special about you, after all. 
I wondered, you see. 
There are strange likenesses between us, after all. 
Even you must have noticed. 
Both half-bloods, orphans, raised by ###CHAR7###. 
Probably the only two Parselmouths to come to ###CHAR26### since the great Slytherin himself We even look something alike ... but after all, it was merely a lucky chance that saved you from me. 
###DIALOGUE###That's all I wanted to know.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### stood, tense, waiting for ###CHAR27### to raise ###CHAR27###'s wand. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###But ###CHAR27###'s twisted smile was widening again. 
###DIALOGUE###``Now, ###CHAR68###, I'm going to teach you a little lesson. 
###DIALOGUE###Let's match the powers of ###CHAR21### , Heir of ###CHAR45### , against famous ###CHAR54### , and the best weapons ###CHAR94### can give ###CHAR94### ...'' ###CHAR27### cast an amused eye over Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, then walked away. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###, fear spreading up ###CHAR68###'s numb legs, watched Ridthe stop between the high pillars and look up into the stone face of Slytherin, high above ###CHAR68### in the half-darkness. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR27### opened ###CHAR27###'s mouth wide and hissed - but ###CHAR68### understood what ###CHAR68### was saying ... ``Speak to me, ###CHAR45###, greatest of the Hogwarts Four. '' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### wheeled around to look up at the statue, Fawkes swaying on his shoulder. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR45###'s gigantic stone face was moving. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Horrorstruck, ###CHAR68### saw ###CHAR68###'s mouth opening, wider and wider, to make a huge black hole. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###And something was stirring inside the statue's mouth. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Something was slithering up from its depths. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### backed away until ###CHAR68### hit the dark Chamber wall, and as ###CHAR68### shut ###CHAR68###'s eyes tight ###CHAR68### felt ###CHAR8###' wing sweep ###CHAR68###'s cheek as ###CHAR68### took flight. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### wanted to shout, ``Don't leave me!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###but what chance did a phoenix have against the king of serpents? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Something huge hit the stone floor of the Chamber. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### felt it shudder - ###CHAR68### knew what was happening, ###CHAR68### could sense it, could almost see the giant serpent uncoiling itself from ###CHAR45###'s mouth. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Then ###CHAR45### heard ###CHAR27###'s hissing voice: ``Kill ###CHAR45###. '' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The basilisk was moving toward ###CHAR68###; ###CHAR68### could hear its heavy body slithering heavily across the dusty floor. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Eyes still tightly shut, ###CHAR68### began to run blindly sideways, ###CHAR68###'s hands outstretched, feeling ###CHAR68###'s way - ###CHAR21### was laughing ###CHAR68### tripped. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### fell hard onto the stone and tasted blood the serpent was barely feet from ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR68### could hear it coming There was a loud, explosive spitting sound right above ###CHAR68###, and then something heavy hit ###CHAR68### so hard that ###CHAR68### was smashed into the wall. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Waiting for fangs to sink through ###CHAR68###'s body ###CHAR68### heard more mad hissing, something thrashing wildly off the pillars ###CHAR68### couldn't help it - ###CHAR68### opened ###CHAR68###'s eyes wide enough to squint at what was going on. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The enormous serpent, bright, poisonous green, thick as an oak trunk, had raised itself high in the air and its great blunt head was weaving drunkenly between the pillars. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###As ###CHAR68### trembled, ready to close ###CHAR68###'s eyes if it turned, ###CHAR68### saw what had distracted the snake. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR8### was soaring around its head, and the basilisk was snapping furiously at ###CHAR8### with fangs long and thin as sabers Fawkes dived. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###His long golden beak sank out of sight and a sudden shower of dark blood spattered the floor. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The snake's tail thrashed, narrowly missing ###CHAR68###, and before ###CHAR68### could shut ###CHAR68###'s eyes, it turned - ###CHAR68### looked straight into its face and saw that its eyes, both its great, bulbous yellow eyes, had been punctured by the phoenix; blood was streaming to the floor, and the snake was spitting in agony. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``NO!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### heard Riddle screaming. 
###DIALOGUE###``LEAVE THE BIRD! 
LEAVE THE BIRD! 
THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU. 
YOU CAN STILL SMELL HIM. 
###DIALOGUE###KILL HIM!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The blinded serpent swayed, confused, still deadly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR8### was circling its head, piping ###CHAR68###'s eerie song, jabbing here and there at its scaly nose as the blood poured from its ruined eyes. 
###DIALOGUE###``Help me, help me,'' ###CHAR68### muttered wildly, ``someone - anyone The snake's tail whipped across the floor again. 
###CHAR68### ducked. 
Something soft hit ###CHAR68###'s face. 
The basilisk had swept the Sorting Hat into ###CHAR68###'s arms. 
###CHAR68### seized it. 
It was all ###CHAR68### had left, ###CHAR68###'s only chance - ###CHAR68### rammed it onto ###CHAR68###'s head and threw himself flat onto the floor as the basilisk's tail swung over ###CHAR68### again. 
Help me - help me - ###CHAR68### thought, ###CHAR68###'s eyes screwed tight under the hat. 
Please help me There was no answering voice. 
Instead, the hat contracted, as though an invisible hand was squeezing it very tightly. 
Something very hard and heavy thudded onto the top of ###CHAR68###'s head, almost knocking ###CHAR68### out. 
Stars winking in front of ###CHAR68###'s eyes, ###CHAR68### grabbed the top of the hat to pull it off and felt something long and hard beneath it. 
A gleaming silver sword had appeared inside the hat, its handle glittering with rubies the size of eggs. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``KILL THE BOY! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###LEAVE THE BIRD! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###SNIFF -- SMELL HIM.'' 
###CHAR68### was on ###CHAR68###'s feet, ready. 
The basilisk's head was falling, its body coiling around, hitting pillars as it twisted to face ###CHAR68###. 
###CHAR68### could see the vast, bloody eye sockets, see the mouth stretching wide, wide enough to swallow ###CHAR68### whole, lined with fangs long as ###CHAR68###'s sword, thin, glittering, venomous - It lunged blindly -- ###CHAR68### dodged and it hit the Chamber wall. 
It lunged again, and its forked tongue lashed ###CHAR68###'s side. 
###CHAR68### raised the sword in both ###CHAR68###'s hands - The basilisk lunged again, and this time its aim was true -- ###CHAR68### threw ###CHAR68###'s whole weight behind the sword and drove it to the hilt into the roof of the serpent's mouth - But as warm blood drenched ###CHAR68###'s arms, ###CHAR68### felt a searing pain just above ###CHAR68###'s elbow. 
One long, poisonous fang was sinking deeper and deeper into ###CHAR68###'s arm and it splintered as the basilisk keeled over sideways and fell, twitching, to the floor. 
###CHAR68### slid down the wall. 
###CHAR68### gripped the fang that was spreading poison through ###CHAR68###'s body and wrenched it out of ###CHAR68###'s arm. 
But ###CHAR68### knew it was too late. 
White-hot pain was spreading slowly and steadily from the wound. 
Even as ###CHAR68### dropped the fang and watched ###CHAR68###'s own blood soaking ###CHAR68###'s robes, ###CHAR68###'s vision went foggy. 
The Chamber was dissolving in a whirl of dull color. 
A patch of scarlet swam past, and ###CHAR68### heard a soft clatter of claws beside ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``Fawkes,'' said ###CHAR68### thickly. 
###DIALOGUE###``You were fantastic, Fawkes ...'' ###CHAR68### felt the bird lay its beautiful head on the spot where the serpent's fang had pierced ###CHAR68###. 
###CHAR68### could hear echoing footsteps and then a dark shadow moved in front of ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``You're dead, ###CHAR54### ,'' said ###CHAR27###'s voice above ###CHAR27###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Dead. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Even ###CHAR94###'s bird knows it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Do you see what ###CHAR94###'s doing, ###CHAR54###? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR94###'s crying.'' 
###CHAR68### blinked. 
Fawke's head slid in and out of focus. 
Thick, pearly tears were trickling down the glossy feathers. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I'm going to sit here and watch you die, ###CHAR54### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Take your time. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I'm in no hurry.'' 
###CHAR68### felt drowsy. 
Everything around ###CHAR68### seemed to be spinning. 
###DIALOGUE###``So ends the famous ###CHAR54### ,'' said ###CHAR27###'s distant voice. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Alone in the Chamber of Secrets, forsaken by ###CHAR54###'s friends, defeated at last by the Dark Lord ###CHAR54### so unwisely challenged. 
###DIALOGUE###You'll be back with your dear Mudblood mother soon, ###CHAR68###... She bought you twelve years of borrowed time ... but ###CHAR21### got you in the end, as you knew ###CHAR21### must ...'' If this is dying, thought ###CHAR68###, it's not so bad. 
Even the pain was leaving ###CHAR68### ... But was this dying? 
Instead of going black, the Chamber seemed to be coming back into focus. 
###CHAR68### gave ###CHAR68###'s head a little shake and there was ###CHAR8###, still resting ###CHAR68###'s head on ###CHAR68###'s arm. 
A pearly patch of tears was shining all around the wound -- except that there was no wound ``Get away, bird,'' said ###CHAR27###'s voice suddenly. 
###DIALOGUE###``Get away from ###CHAR21### - I said, get away --'' ###CHAR68### raised ###CHAR68###'s head. 
###CHAR27### was pointing ###CHAR68###'s wand at Fawkes; there was a bang like a gun, and ###CHAR8### took flight again in a whirl of gold and scarlet. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Phoenix tears. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###- .'' 
said ###CHAR27### quietly, staring at ###CHAR68###'s arm. 
###DIALOGUE###``Of course ... healing powers ... I forgot...'' ###CHAR68### looked into ###CHAR68###'s face. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But it makes no difference. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###In fact, I prefer it this way. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Just you and me, ###CHAR54### ... you and me... ###CHAR54### raised the wand Then, in a rush of wings, ###CHAR8### had soared back overhead and something fell into ###CHAR68###'s lap -- the diary. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###For a split second, both ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR27###, wand still raised, stared at it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Then, without thinking, without considering, as though ###CHAR68### had meant to do it all along, ###CHAR68### seized the basilisk fang on the floor next to ###CHAR68### and plunged it straight into the heart of the book. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There was a long, dreadful, piercing scream. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Ink spurted out of the diary in torrents, streaming over ###CHAR68###'s hands, flooding the floor. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR27### was writhing and twisting, screaming and flailing and then ###CHAR27### had gone. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###'s wand fell to the floor with a clatter and there was silence. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Silence except for the steady drip drip of ink still oozing from the diary. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The basilisk venom had burned a sizzling hole right through it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Shaking all over, ###CHAR68### pulled himself up. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###'s head was spinning as though ###CHAR68###'d just traveled miles by Floo powder. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Slowly, ###CHAR68### gathered together ###CHAR68###'s wand and the Sorting Hat, and, with a huge tug, retrieved the glittering sword from the roof of the basilisk's mouth. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Then came a faint moan from the end of the Chamber. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR76### was stirring. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###As ###CHAR68### hurried toward ###CHAR76###, ###CHAR76### sat up. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR76###'s bemused eyes traveled from the huge form of the dead basilisk, over ###CHAR68###, in ###CHAR68###'s blood-soaked robes, then to the diary in ###CHAR68###'s hand. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR76### drew a great, shuddering gasp and tears began to pour down ###CHAR76###'s face. 
###DIALOGUE###``Harry -- oh, ###CHAR68### -- I tried to tell you at b-breakfast, but I c-couldn't say it in front of Percy -- it was me, ###CHAR68### -- but I -- I s-swear I ddiddt mean to -- R-Riddle made me, ###CHAR68### t-took me over -- and - how did you kill that -- that thing? 
W-where's Riddle? 
The last thing I rremember is him coming out of the diary --'' '' It's all right,'' said ###CHAR68###, holding up the diary, and showing ###CHAR76### the fang hole, ``Riddle's finished. 
Look! 
Him and the basilisk. 
###DIALOGUE###C'mon, ###CHAR76###, let's get out of here --'' ``I'm going to be expelled!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR76### wept as ###CHAR68### helped ###CHAR76###'s awkwardly to ###CHAR76###'s feet. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I've looked forward to coming to ###CHAR26### ever since B-Bill came and n-now I'll have to leave and -- w-what'll Mum and Dad say?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR8### was waiting for them, hovering in the Chamber entrance. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### urged ###CHAR76### forward; they stepped over the motionless coils of the dead basilisk, through the echoing gloom, and back into the tunnel. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### heard the stone doors close behind them with a soft hiss. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###After a few minutes' progress up the dark tunnel, a distant sound of slowly shifting rock reached ###CHAR68###'s ears. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR68###!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### yelled, speeding up. 
###DIALOGUE###``###CHAR76###'s okay! 
###DIALOGUE###I've got ###CHAR76###'s !'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### heard ###CHAR68### give a strangled cheer, and they turned the next bend to see ###CHAR68###'s eager face staring through the sizable gap ###CHAR68### had managed to make in the rock fall. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR76###!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### thrust an arm through the gap in the rock to pull 32 ###CHAR68###'s through first. 
###DIALOGUE###``You're alive! 
I don't believe it! 
###DIALOGUE###What happened?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###How - what -- where did that bird come from?'' 
###CHAR8### had swooped through the gap after ###CHAR76###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR68###'s ###CHAR94###'s,'' said ###CHAR68###, squeezing through himself ``How come you've got a sword?'' 
said ###CHAR68###, gaping at the glittering weapon in ###CHAR68###'s hand. 
###DIALOGUE###``I'll explain when we get out of here,'' said ###CHAR68### with a sideways glance at ###CHAR76###, who was crying harder than ever. 
###DIALOGUE###``But --'' ``Later,'' ###CHAR68### said shortly. 
###CHAR68### didn't think it was a good idea to tell ###CHAR68### yet who'd been opening the Chamber, not in front of ###CHAR76###, anyway. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Where's ###CHAR73###?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Back there,'' said ###CHAR68###, still looking puzzled but jerking ###CHAR68###'s head up the tunnel toward the pipe. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR73###'s in a bad way. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Come and see.'' 
Led by ###CHAR8###, whose wide scarlet wings emitted a soft golden glow in the darkness, they walked all the way back to the mouth of the pipe. 
###CHAR73### was sitting there, humming placidly to himself. 
###DIALOGUE###``###CHAR73###'s memory's gone,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``The Memory Charm backfired. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Hit ###CHAR73### instead of us. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Hasn't got a clue who ###CHAR73### is, or where ###CHAR73### is, or who we are. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I told ###CHAR73### to come and wait here. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR73###'s a danger to himself'' ###CHAR73### peered good-naturedly up at them all. 
###DIALOGUE###``Hello,'' ###CHAR68### said. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Odd sort of place, this, isn't it? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Do you live here?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``No,'' said ###CHAR68###, raising ###CHAR68###'s eyebrows at ###CHAR68###. 
###CHAR68### bent down and looked up the long, dark pipe. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Have you thought how we're going to get back up this?'' 
###CHAR68### said to ###CHAR68###. 
###CHAR68### shook ###CHAR68###'s head, but Fawkes the phoenix had swooped past ###CHAR68### and was now fluttering in front of ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR68###'s beady eyes bright in the dark. 
###CHAR68### was waving ###CHAR68###'s long golden tail feathers. 
###CHAR68### looked uncertainly at ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``###CHAR73### looks like ###CHAR73### wants you to grab hold...'' said ###CHAR68###, looking perplexed. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But you're much too heavy for a bird to pull up there -'' ``Fawkes,'' said ###CHAR68###, ``isn't an ordinary bird.'' 
###CHAR68### turned quickly to the others. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We've got to hold on to each other. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR76###, grab ###CHAR68###'s hand. 
###DIALOGUE###Professor ###CHAR73### --'' ``###CHAR73### means you,'' said ###CHAR68### sharply to ###CHAR73###. 
###DIALOGUE###``You hold ###CHAR76###'s other hand --'' ###CHAR68### tucked the sword and the Sorting Hat into ###CHAR68###'s belt, ###CHAR68### took hold of the back of ###CHAR68###'s robes, and ###CHAR68### reached out and took hold of Fawkes's strangely hot tail feathers. 
An extraordinary lightness seemed to spread through ###CHAR68###'s whole body and the next second, in a rush of wings, they were flying upward through the pipe. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR68### could hear ###CHAR73### dangling below ###CHAR68###, saying, ``Amazing! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Amazing! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###This is just like magic!'' 
The chill air was whipping through ###CHAR68###'s hair, and before ###CHAR68###'d stopped enjoying the ride, it was over -- all four of them were hitting the wet floor of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom, and as ###CHAR73### straightened ###CHAR73###'s hat, the sink that hid the pipe was sliding back into place. 
Myrtle goggled at them. 
###DIALOGUE###``You're alive,'' she said blankly to ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``There's no need to sound so disappointed,'' ###CHAR68### said grimly, wiping flecks of blood and slime off ###CHAR68###'s glasses. 
###DIALOGUE###``Oh, well ... Id just been thinking ... if you had died, you'd have been welcome to share my toilet,'' said Myrtle, blushing silver. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Urgh!'' 
said ###CHAR68### as they left the bathroom for the dark, deserted corridor outside. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Harry! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I think ###CHAR20###'s grown fond of you! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###You've got competition, ###CHAR76###!'' 
But tears were still flooding silently down ###CHAR76###'s face. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Where now?'' 
said ###CHAR68###, with an anxious look at ###CHAR76###. 
###CHAR68### pointed. 
###CHAR8### was leading the way, glowing gold along the corridor. 
They strode after ###CHAR68###, and moments later, found themselves outside Professor ###CHAR96###'s office. 
###CHAR68### knocked and pushed the door open.
###CHAR48###'S REWARD
For a moment there was silence as ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR76###, and ###CHAR73### stood in the doorway, covered in muck and slime and -LRB-in ###CHAR68###'s case-RRB- blood. 
Then there was a scream. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR76###!'' 
It was ###CHAR83### , who had been sitting crying in front of the fire. 
###CHAR83### leapt to ###CHAR83###'s feet, closely followed by ###CHAR84### , and both of them flung themselves on their daughter. 
###CHAR68###, however, was looking past them. 
Professor ###CHAR94### was standing by the mantelpiece, beaming, next to Professor ###CHAR96###, who was taking great, steadying gasps, clutching her chest. 
###CHAR8### went whooshing past ###CHAR68###'s ear and settled on ###CHAR94###'s shoulder, just as ###CHAR68### found himself and ###CHAR68### being swept into ###CHAR51### tight embrace. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You saved ###CHAR76###! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###You saved ###CHAR76###! 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###How did you do it?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``I think we'd all like to know that,'' said Professor ###CHAR96### weakly. 
###CHAR83### let go of ###CHAR68###, who hesitated for a moment, then walked over to the desk and laid upon it the Sorting Hat, the rubyencrusted sword, and what remained of ###CHAR27###'s diary. 
Then ###CHAR27### started telling them everything. 
###DIALOGUE###For nearly a quarter of an hour ###CHAR27### spoke into the rapt silence: ###CHAR27### told them about hearing the disembodied voice, how ###CHAR25### had finally realized that ###CHAR27### was hearing a basilisk in the pipes; how ###CHAR27### and ###CHAR68### had followed the spiders into the forest, that ###CHAR82### had told them where the last victim of the basilisk had died; how he had guessed that Moaning ###CHAR20### had been the victim, and that the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets might be in ###CHAR20###'s bathroom ... ``Very well,'' Professor ###CHAR96### prompted him as he paused, ``so you found out where the entrance was -- breaking a hundred school rules into pieces along the way, I might add - but how on earth did you all get out of there alive, ###CHAR54###?'' 
So ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR68###'s voice now growing hoarse from all this talking, told them about ###CHAR8###'s timely arrival and about the Sorting Hat giving ###CHAR68### the sword. 
But then ###CHAR68### faltered. 
###CHAR68### had so far avoided mentioning ###CHAR27###'s diary -- or ###CHAR76###. 
###CHAR76### was standing with ###CHAR76###'s head against ###CHAR83### 's shoulder, and tears were still coursing silently down ###CHAR76###'s cheeks. 
What if they expelled ###CHAR76###? 
###CHAR68### thought in panic. 
###CHAR27###'s diary didn't work anymore ... How could they prove it had been ###CHAR68### who'd made ###CHAR76###'s do it all? 
Instinctively, ###CHAR68### looked at ###CHAR94###, who smiled faintly, the firelight glancing off ###CHAR68###'s half-moon spectacles. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What interests me most,'' said ###CHAR94### gently, ``is how ###CHAR21### managed to enchant ###CHAR76###, when my sources tell me ###CHAR21### is currently in hiding in the forests of Albania.'' 
Relief -- warm, sweeping, glorious relief -- swept over ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Wwhat's that?'' 
said ###CHAR84### in a stunned voice. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``YouKnow-Who? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###En-enchant ###CHAR76###? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###But ###CHAR76###'s not ... ###CHAR76### hasn't been ... has ###CHAR76###?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``It was this diary,'' said ###CHAR68### quickly, picking it up and showing it to ###CHAR94###. 
###DIALOGUE###``###CHAR27### wrote it when ###CHAR27### was sixteen ...'' ###CHAR94### took the diary from ###CHAR68### and peered keenly down ###CHAR68###'s long, crooked nose at its burnt and soggy pages. 
###DIALOGUE###``Brilliant,'' ###CHAR68### said softly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Of course, ###CHAR27### was probably the most brilliant student ###CHAR26### has ever seen.'' 
###CHAR68### turned around to the Weasleys, who were looking utterly bewildered. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Very few people know that ###CHAR21### was once called ###CHAR11### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I taught ###CHAR21### myself, fifty years ago, at Hogwarts. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR21### disappeared after leaving the school ... traveled far and wide ... sank so deeply into the Dark Arts, consorted with the very worst of our kind, underwent so many dangerous, magical transformations, that when ###CHAR21### resurfaced as ###CHAR21### , ###CHAR21### was barely recognizable. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Hardly anyone connected ###CHAR21### with the clever, handsome boy who was once Head Boy here.'' 
###DIALOGUE###``But, ###CHAR76###,'' said ###CHAR83### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What's our ###CHAR76### got to do with - with -- him?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``His d-diaryl'' ###CHAR76### sobbed. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I've b-been writing in it, and he's been w-writing back all year --'' ``tinny!'' 
said ###CHAR84### , flabbergasted. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Haven't I taught you anything. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###What have I always told you? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can't see where it keeps its brain? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Why didn't you show the diary to me, or your mother? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###A suspicious object like that, it was clearly full of Dark Magic =' ``I d-didn't know,'' sobbed ###CHAR76###. 
###DIALOGUE###``I found it inside one of the books Mum got me. 
###DIALOGUE###I th-thought someone had just left it in there and forgotten about it --'' ``###CHAR23### should go up to the hospital wing right away,'' ###CHAR94### interrupted in a firm voice. 
###DIALOGUE###``This has been a terrible ordeal for ###CHAR23###. 
There will be no punishment. 
###DIALOGUE###Older and wiser wizards than ###CHAR23### have been hoodwinked by ###CHAR21### .'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR94### strode over to the door and opened it. 
###DIALOGUE###``Bed rest and perhaps a large, steaming mug of hot chocolate. 
###DIALOGUE###I always find that cheers me up,'' ###CHAR94### added, twinkling kindly down at ###CHAR76###. 
###DIALOGUE###``You will find that ###CHAR98### is still awake. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR98###'s just giving out Mandrake juice -- I daresay the basilisk's victims will be waking up any moment.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``So ###CHAR25###'s okay!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68### brightly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``There has been no lasting harm done, ###CHAR76###,'' said ###CHAR94###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR83### led ###CHAR76### out, and ###CHAR84### followed, still looking deeply shaken. 
###DIALOGUE###``You know, Minerva,'' Professor ###CHAR94### said thoughtfully to Professor ###CHAR96###, ``I think all this merits a good feast. 
###DIALOGUE###Might I ask you to go and alert the kitchens?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Right,'' said Professor ###CHAR96### crisply, also moving to the door. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I'll leave you to deal with ###CHAR54### and ###CHAR55###, shall I?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Certainly,'' said ###CHAR94###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR83### left, and ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### gazed uncertainly at Dumbledore. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###What exactly had Professor ###CHAR96### meant, deal with them? 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Surely - surely - they weren't about to be punished? 
###DIALOGUE###``I seem to remember telling you both that I would have to expel you if you broke any more school rules, said ###CHAR94###. 
###CHAR68### opened ###CHAR94###'s mouth in horror. 
###DIALOGUE###``Which goes to show that the best of us must sometimes eat our words,'' ###CHAR94### went on, smiling. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You will both receive Special Awards for Services to the School and -- let me see - yes, I think two hundred points apiece for Gryffindor.'' 
###CHAR68### went as briglitly pink as ###CHAR73###'s valentine flowers and closed ###CHAR68###'s mouth again. 
###DIALOGUE###``But one of us seems to be keeping mightily quiet about ###CHAR94###'s part in this dangerous adventure,'' ###CHAR94### added. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Why so modest, ###CHAR73###?'' 
###CHAR68### gave a start. 
###CHAR94### had completely forgotten about ###CHAR73###. 
###CHAR94### turned and saw that ###CHAR73### was standing in a corner of the room, still wearing ###CHAR73###'s vague smile. 
When ###CHAR94### addressed ###CHAR94###, ###CHAR73### looked over ###CHAR73###'s shoulder to see who ###CHAR94### was talking to. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Professor ###CHAR94###,'' ###CHAR68### said quickly, ``there was an accident down in the Chamber of Secrets. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Professor ###CHAR73### --'' ``Am I a professor?'' 
said ###CHAR73### in mild surprise. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Goodness. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I expect I was hopeless, was I?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``###CHAR73### tried to do a Memory Charm and the wand backfired,'' ###CHAR68### explained quietly to ###CHAR94###. 
###DIALOGUE###``Dear me,'' said ###CHAR94###, shaking ###CHAR94###'s head, ###CHAR94###'s long silver mustache quivering. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Impaled upon your own sword, ###CHAR73###!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Sword?'' 
said ###CHAR73### dimly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Haven't got a sword. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###That boy has, though.'' 
###CHAR73### pointed at Harry. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``He'll lend you one.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Would you mind taking Professor ###CHAR73### up to the infirmary, too?'' 
###CHAR94### said to ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Id like a few more words with ###CHAR68### ... ###CHAR73### ambled out. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### cast a curious look back at Dumbledore and ###CHAR68### as he closed the door. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR94### crossed to one of the chairs by the fire. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Sit down, ###CHAR68###,'' ###CHAR94### said, and ###CHAR68### sat, feeling unaccountably nervous. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``First of all, ###CHAR68###, I want to thank you,'' said ###CHAR94###, eyes twinkling again. 
###DIALOGUE###``You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. 
###DIALOGUE###Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR94### stroked the phoenix, which had fluttered down onto ###CHAR94###'s knee. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### grinned awkwardly as ###CHAR94### watched ###CHAR94###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``And so you met ###CHAR11### ,'' said ###CHAR94### thoughtfully. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I imagine ###CHAR11### was most interested in you ... '' Suddenly, something that was nagging at ###CHAR68### came tumbling out of ###CHAR94###'s mouth. 
###DIALOGUE###``Professor ###CHAR94### ... ###CHAR27### said I'm like ###CHAR94###. 
###DIALOGUE###Strange likenesses, ###CHAR94### said ...'' ``Did ###CHAR94###, now?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR94###, looking thoughtfully at ###CHAR68### from under ###CHAR94###'s thick silver eyebrows. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``And what do you think, ###CHAR68###?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I don't think I'm like ###CHAR68###!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68###, more loudly than ###CHAR68###'d intended. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I mean, I'm -- I'm in Gryffindor, I'm ...'' But ###CHAR68### fell silent, a lurking doubt resurfacing in ###CHAR68###'s mind. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Professor,'' ###CHAR68### started again after a moment. 
###DIALOGUE###``The Sorting Hat told me Id -- Id have done well in Slytherin. 
###DIALOGUE###Everyone thought I was Slytherin's heir for a while ... because I can speak Parseltongue ... ``You can speak Parseltongue, ###CHAR68###,'' said ###CHAR94### calmly, ``because ###CHAR21### -- who is the last remaining ancestor of Salazar Slytherin -- can speak Parseltongue. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Unless I'm much mistaken, ###CHAR68### transferred some of ###CHAR68###'s own powers to you the night ###CHAR68### gave you that scar. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Not something ###CHAR68### intended to do, I'm sure ... ``###CHAR21### put a bit of himself in me?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### said, thunderstruck. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It certainly seems so.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``So I should be in Slytherin,'' ###CHAR68### said, looking desperately into ###CHAR94###'s face. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``The Sorting Hat could see ###CHAR45###'s power in me, and it --'' ``Put you in Gryffindor,'' said ###CHAR94### calmly. 
###DIALOGUE###``Listen to me, ###CHAR68###. 
You happen to have many qualities ###CHAR45### prized in ###CHAR68###'s handpicked students. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR68###'s own very rare gift, Parseltongue - resourcefulness - determination -- a certain disregard for rules,'' ###CHAR94### added, ###CHAR94###'s mustache quivering again. 
###DIALOGUE###``Yet the Sorting Hat placed you in Gryffindor. 
You know why that was. 
###DIALOGUE###Think.'' 
###DIALOGUE###``It only put me in Gryffindor,'' said ###CHAR68### in a defeated voice, ``because I asked not to go in Slytherin ...'' `Exactly, ``said ###CHAR94###, beaming once more. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Which makes you very different from ###CHAR11### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###It is our choices, ###CHAR68###, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.'' 
###CHAR68### sat motionless in ###CHAR68###'s chair, stunned. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``If you want proof, ###CHAR68###, that you belong in Gryffindor, I suggest you look more closely at this.'' 
###CHAR94### reached across to Professor ###CHAR96###'s desk, picked up the blood-stained silver sword, and handed it to ###CHAR68###. 
Dully, ###CHAR68### turned it over, the rubies blazing in the firelight. 
And then ###CHAR68### saw the name engraved just below the hilt. 
###CHAR99### ``Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat, ###CHAR68###,'' said ###CHAR94### simply. 
For a minute, neither of them spoke. 
Then ###CHAR94### pulled open one of the drawers in Professor ###CHAR96###'s desk and took out a quill and a bottle of ink. 
What you need, ###CHAR68###, is some food and sleep. 
I suggest you go down to the feast, while I write to Azkaban -- we need our gamekeeper back. 
###DIALOGUE###And I must draft an advertisement for the Daily Prophet, too,'' he added thoughtfully. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We'll be needing a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher... Dear me, we do seem to run through them, don't we?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### got up and crossed to the door. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### had just reached for the handle, however, when the door burst open so violently that it bounced back off the wall. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR50### stood there, fury in ###CHAR50###'s face. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###And cowering behind ###CHAR50###'s legs, heavily wrapped in bandages, was ###CHAR48###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Good evening, ###CHAR50###,'' said ###CHAR94### pleasantly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR50### almost knocked ###CHAR68### over as ###CHAR68### swept into the room. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR48### went scurrying in after ###CHAR68###, crouching at the hem of ###CHAR68###'s cloak, a look of abject terror on ###CHAR68###'s face. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The elf was carrying a stained rag with which ###CHAR68### was attempting to finish cleaning Mr. Malfoys shoes. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Apparently ###CHAR50### had set out in a great hurry, for not only were ###CHAR50###'s shoes half-polished, but ###CHAR50###'s usually sleek hair was disheveled. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Ignoring the elf bobbing apologetically around ###CHAR50###'s ankles, ###CHAR50### fixed ###CHAR50###'s cold eyes upon ###CHAR94###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``So!'' 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR94### said ``You've come back. 
###DIALOGUE###The governors suspended you, but you still saw fit to return to Hogwarts.'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Well, you see, ###CHAR50###,'' said ###CHAR94###, smiling serenely, ``the other eleven governors contacted me today. 
It was something like being caught in a hailstorm of owls, to tell the truth. 
They'd heard that Arthur Weasleys daughter had been killed and wanted me back here at once. 
They seemed to think I was the best man for the job after all. 
###DIALOGUE###Very strange tales they told me, too ... Several of them seemed to think that you had threatened to curse their families if they didn't agree to suspend me in the first place.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR50### went even paler than usual, but ###CHAR50###'s eyes were still slits of fury. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``So -- have you stopped the attacks yet?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR50### sneered. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Have you caught the culprit?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``We have,'' said ###CHAR94###, with a smile. 
###DIALOGUE###``Well?
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``said ###CHAR50### sharply. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Who is it?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``The same person as last time, ###CHAR50###,'' said ###CHAR94###. 
###DIALOGUE###``But this time, ###CHAR21### was acting through somebody else. 
###DIALOGUE###By means of this diary.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR94### held up the small black book with the large hole through the center, watching ###CHAR50### closely. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###, however, was watching ###CHAR48###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The elf was doing something very odd. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###'s great eyes fixed meaningfully on ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR68### kept pointing at the diary, then at ###CHAR50### , and then hitting himself hard on the head with ###CHAR50###'s fist. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``I see... '' said ###CHAR50### slowly to ###CHAR94###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``A clever plan,'' said ###CHAR94### in a level voice, still staring ###CHAR50### straight in the eye. 
###DIALOGUE###``Because if ###CHAR68### here'' --###CHAR50### shot ###CHAR68### a swift, sharp look -- ``and ###CHAR68###'s friend ###CHAR68### hadn't discovered this book, why -- ###CHAR76### might have taken all the blame. 
###DIALOGUE###No one would ever have been able to prove ###CHAR76### hadn't acted of ###CHAR76###'s own free will ...'' ###CHAR50### said nothing. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR50###'s face was suddenly masklike. 
###DIALOGUE###``And imagine,'' ###CHAR94### went on, ``what might have happened then ... The Weasleys are one of our most prominent pure-blood families. 
Imagine the effect on ###CHAR64### and ###CHAR64###'s Muggle Protection Act, if ###CHAR64###'s own daughter was discovered attacking and - killing Muggle-borns ... Very fortunate the diary was discovered, and ###CHAR27###'s memories wiped from it. 
###DIALOGUE###``Who knows what the consequences might have been otherwise ...'' ###CHAR50### forced himself to speak. 
###DIALOGUE###``Very fortunate,'' ###CHAR50### said stiffly. 
And still, behind ###CHAR50###'s back, ###CHAR48### was pointing, first to the diary, then to ###CHAR50### , then punching himself in the head. 
And Harry suddenly understood. 
He nodded at Dobby, and ###CHAR48### backed into a corner, now twisting his ears in punishment. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Don't you want to know how ###CHAR76### got hold of that diary, ###CHAR50### ?'' 
said ###CHAR68###. 
###CHAR50### rounded on ###CHAR50###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``How should I know how the stupid little girl got hold of it?'' 
###CHAR50### said. 
###DIALOGUE###``Because you gave it to her,'' said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``In Flourish and Blotts. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###You picked up her old Transfiguration book and slipped the diary inside it, didn't you?'' 
###CHAR68### saw ###CHAR50### 's white hands clench and unclench. 
###DIALOGUE###``Prove it,'' ###CHAR50### hissed. 
###DIALOGUE###``Oh, no one will be able to do that,'' said ###CHAR94###, smiling at ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Not now that ###CHAR27### has vanished from the book. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###On the other hand, I would advise you, ###CHAR50###, not to go giving out any more of ###CHAR21### 's old school things. 
###DIALOGUE###If any more of them find their way into innocent hands, I think ###CHAR64### , for one, will make sure they are traced back to you ...'' ###CHAR50### stood for a moment, and ###CHAR68### distinctly saw ###CHAR68###'s right hand twitch as though ###CHAR68### was longing to reach for ###CHAR68###'s wand. 
###DIALOGUE###Instead, ###CHAR68### turned to ###CHAR68###'s house-elf ``We're going, ###CHAR48###!'' 
###CHAR68### wrenched open the door and as the elf came hurrying up to ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR68### kicked ###CHAR68### right through it. 
They could hear ###CHAR48### squealing with pain all the way along the corridor. 
###CHAR68### stood for a moment, thinking hard. 
Then it came to ###CHAR68### - ``Professor ###CHAR94###,'' ###CHAR68### said hurriedly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Can I give that diary back to ###CHAR50### , please?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Certainly, ###CHAR68###,'' said ###CHAR94### calmly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``But hurry. 
###DIALOGUE###The feast, remember ...'' ###CHAR68### grabbed the diary and dashed out of the office. 
###CHAR68### could hear ###CHAR48###'s squeals of pain receding around the corner. 
Quickly, wondering if this plan could possibly work, ###CHAR68### took off one of ###CHAR68###'s shoes, pulled off ###CHAR68###'s slimy, filthy sock, and stuffed the diary into it. 
Then ###CHAR68### ran down the dark corridor. 
###CHAR68### caught up with them at the top of the stairs. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR50### ,'' ###CHAR68### gasped, skidding to a halt, ``I've got something for you --'' And ###CHAR68### forced the smelly sock into ###CHAR50### 's hand. ''-RRB-
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###What the --?'' 
###CHAR50### ripped the sock off the diary, threw it aside, then looked furiously from the ruined book to ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###You'll meet the same sticky end as your parents one of these days, ###CHAR54### ,'' ###CHAR54### said softly. 
###DIALOGUE###``They were meddlesome fools, too. 
###CHAR50### turned to go. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Come, ###CHAR48###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###I said, come.'' 
But ###CHAR48### didn't move. 
###CHAR54### was holding up ###CHAR68###'s disgusting, slimy sock, and looking at it as though it were a priceless treasure. 
###DIALOGUE###``Master has given a sock,'' said the elf in wonderment. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Master gave it to ###CHAR48###.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What's that?'' 
spat ###CHAR50### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What did you say?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Got a sock,'' said ###CHAR48### in disbelief. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Master threw it, and ###CHAR48### caught it, and ###CHAR48### -- ###CHAR48### is free. '' 
###CHAR50### stood frozen, staring at the elf Then ###CHAR50### lunged at ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You've lost me my servant, boy!'' 
###DIALOGUE###But ###CHAR48### shouted, ``You shall not harm ###CHAR54### !'' 
There was a loud bang, and ###CHAR50### was thrown backward. 
###CHAR50### crashed down the stairs, three at a time, landing in a crumpled heap on the landing below. 
###CHAR50### got up, ###CHAR50###'s face livid, and pulled out ###CHAR50###'s wand, but ###CHAR48### raised a long, threatening finger. 
###DIALOGUE###``You shall go now,'' ###CHAR50### said fiercely, pointing down at ###CHAR50### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You shall not touch ###CHAR54### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###You shall go now.'' 
###CHAR50### had no choice. 
With a last, incensed stare at the pair of them, ###CHAR50### swung ###CHAR50###'s cloak around ###CHAR50### and hurried out of sight. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR54### freed ###CHAR48###!'' 
said the elf shrilly, gazing up at ###CHAR68###, moonlight from the nearest window reflected in ###CHAR68###'s orb-like eyes. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR54### set ###CHAR48### free!'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Least I could do, ###CHAR48###,'' said ###CHAR68###, grinning. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Just promise never to try and save my life again.'' 
The elf's ugly brown face split suddenly into a wide, toothy smile. 
###DIALOGUE###``I've just got one question, ###CHAR48###,'' said ###CHAR68### as ###CHAR48### pulled on ###CHAR68###'s sock with shaking hands. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``You told me all this had nothing to do with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, remember? 
###DIALOGUE###Well --'' ``It was a clue, sir,'' said ###CHAR48###, ###CHAR68###'s eyes widening, as though this was obvious. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Was giving you a clue. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The Dark Lord, before he changed his name, could be freely named, you see?'' 
###DIALOGUE###``Right,'' said ###CHAR68### weakly. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Well, Id better go. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###There's a feast, and my friend ###CHAR25### should be awake by now ... ###CHAR48### threw his arms around ###CHAR68###'s middle and hugged ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR54### is greater by far than ###CHAR48### knew!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### sobbed. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Farewell, ###CHAR54### !'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###And with a final loud crack, ###CHAR48### disappeared. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### had been to several ###CHAR26### feasts, but never one quite like this. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Everybody was in their pajamas, and the celebration lasted all night. 
###DIALOGUE######CHAR68### didn't know whether the best bit was ###CHAR25### running toward ###CHAR68###, screaming ``You solved it! 
###DIALOGUE###You solved it!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###or ###CHAR100### hurrying over from the ###CHAR80### table to wring. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###'s hand and apologize endlessly for suspecting ###CHAR68###, or Hagrid turning up at half past three, cuffing ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR68### so hard on the shoulders that they were knocked into their plates of trifle, or ###CHAR68###'s and ###CHAR68###'s four hundred points for Gryffindor securing the House Cup for the second year running, or Professor ###CHAR96### standing up to tell them all that the exams had been canceled as a school treat -LRB-``Oh, no!'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR25###-RRB-, or ###CHAR94### announcing that, unfortunately, Professor ###CHAR73### would be unable to return next year, owing to the fact that ###CHAR73### needed to go away and get ###CHAR73###'s memory back. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Quite a few of the teachers joined in the cheering that greeted this news. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Shame,'' said ###CHAR68###, helping himself to a jam doughnut. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR54### was starting to grow on me.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The rest of the final term passed in a haze of blazing sunshine. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR26### was back to normal with only a few, small differences - Defense Against the Dark Arts classes were canceled -LRB-``but we've had plenty of practice at that anyway,'' ###CHAR68### told a disgruntled ###CHAR25###-RRB- and ###CHAR50### had been sacked as a school governor. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR0### was no longer strutting around the school as though ###CHAR0### owned the place. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###On the contrary, ###CHAR0### looked resentful and sulky. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###On the other hand, ###CHAR76### was perfectly happy again. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###Too soon, it was time for the journey home on the ###CHAR62### . 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68###, ###CHAR68###, ###CHAR25###, ###CHAR55###, ###CHAR19###, and ###CHAR76### got a compartment to themselves. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They made the most of the last few hours in which they were allowed to do magic before the holidays. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They played Exploding Snap, set off the very last of ###CHAR55### and ###CHAR19###'s Filibuster fireworks, and practiced disarming each other by magic. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### was getting very good at it. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###They were almost at King's Cross when ###CHAR68### remembered something. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``###CHAR76### - what did you see ###CHAR70### doing, that ###CHAR70### didn't want you to tell anyone?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Oh, that,'' said ###CHAR76###, giggling. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Well - ###CHAR70###'s got a girlfriend.'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR55### dropped a stack of books on ###CHAR19###'s head. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``What?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``It's that Ravenclaw prefect, ###CHAR61### ,'' said ###CHAR76###. 
###DIALOGUE###``That's who he was writing to all last summer. 
He's been meeting ###CHAR61###'s all over the school in secret. 
I walked in on them kissing in an empty classroom one day. 
He was so upset when ###CHAR61### was -- you know - attacked. 
###DIALOGUE###You won't tease him, will you?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR76### added anxiously. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Wouldn't dream of it,'' said ###CHAR55###, who was looking like ###CHAR55###'s birthday had come early. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Definitely not,'' said ###CHAR19###, sniggering. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###The ###CHAR62### slowed and finally stopped. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY######CHAR68### pulled out ###CHAR68###'s quill and a bit of parchment and turned to ###CHAR68### and ###CHAR25###. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``This is called a telephone number,'' ###CHAR68### told ###CHAR68###, scribbling it twice, tearing the parchment in two, and handing it to them. 
###DIALOGUE###``I told your dad how to use a telephone last summer - he'll know. 
Call me at the ###CHAR88###', okay? 
###DIALOGUE###I can't stand another two months with only ###CHAR1### to talk to ...'' ``Your aunt and uncle will be proud, though, won't they?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR25### as they got off the train and joined the crowd thronging toward the enchanted barrier. 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``When they hear what you did this year?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###``Proud?'' 
###DIALOGUE-ONLY###said ###CHAR68###. 
###DIALOGUE###``Are you crazy? 
All those times I could've died, and I didn't manage it?
